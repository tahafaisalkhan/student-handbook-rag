SCHOOLS AT LUMS 
 
SULEMAN DAWOOD SCHOOL OF BUSINESS 
 
Since its establishment in 1986, the Business School at Lahore University of Management Sciences has 
become a national and regional leader in business education. Named in honour of the late business leader 
and entrepreneur, Mr. Suleman Dawood, for the generous support extended by his family, the Suleman 
Dawood School of Business (SDSB) is Pakistan's first business school to achieve international accreditation 
by AACSB – The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. For over a century, AACSB has been 
a global benchmark in evaluating business school quality based on programme relevance, impact, and 
overall educational experience. To date, less than 6% of the world's business schools have earned AACSB 
accreditation. This accreditation serves as a testament to the high-quality education and impactful 
intellectual contributions of SDSB faculty. As a premier AACSB-accredited institution, SDSB prepares 
graduates who lead, transform, and make a lasting impact on business and society. 
 
The school's mission is to promote ethical and thoughtful leadership, influence practice and policy through 
innovative knowledge generation, and provide a transformative learning experience. A pioneer in the 
region, SDSB was initially inspired by Harvard Business School's teaching philosophy and has embraced the 
case method pedagogy. It boasts one of Asia's largest case study databases. Alongside case-based learning, 
the programmes are enhanced with a strong experiential component. Regular curriculum reviews, 
influenced by industry leaders and an extensive alumni network, ensure the programmes stay aligned with 
current business needs. 
 
SDSB is committed to leading the evolution of management thought and advancing organisational practices 
that have a substantial societal impact. In support of these goals, the Centre for Business and Society (CBS) 
serves as a dedicated multidisciplinary hub, fostering discussions at the nexus of business and societal 
change and rethinking the role of businesses in creating sustainable societies. Under the women's 
scholarship initiative, the school grants a 50% tuition fee waiver to all women admitted on high merit to its 
graduate programmes. These initiatives place SDSB among the most forward-thinking business schools 
globally, aiming to foster societal development by promoting diversity, inclusivity, and equity. 
 
The Suleman Dawood School of Business (SDSB) offers a four-year BSc (Honours) degree in the following 
majors: 
• 
Accounting and Finance 
• 
Management Science 
 
In addition to the above majors, SDSB offers minors in the following disciplines: 
• Public Management 
• Computational Finance 
 
Additionally, executive courses taught by SDSB faculty at the Rausing Executive Development Centre 
(REDC) provide a vital link between the faculty and business executives, ensuring that the curriculum 
remains relevant to evolving business landscapes and facilitating impactful corporate relationships 
 
Suleman Dawood School of Business has the vision to develop ideas and people to shape business and 
society; this is achieved by nurturing trailblazers and changemakers who don't just add value but create it. 
We welcome you to explore our programmes and see for yourself.

SHAIKH AHMAD HASSAN SCHOOL OF LAW 
 
The Shaikh Ahmad Hassan School of Law (SAHSOL) combines the richness of liberal arts and 
interdisciplinary education with a solid professional training in law. The Law School offers a five-year BA.LLB 
(Honours) degree. LUMS has been offering the BA.LLB programme since 2003; first under the Department 
of Law and Policy of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences; and since 2012, as one of LUMS’ five 
Schools, housed in its own law school building, benefitting from state-of-the-art student services and 
facilities. 
The BA.LLB programme is split into two parts: in the first two years of the B.A. phase, students are 
introduced to a wide variety of subjects offered by the other schools of LUMS. During this stage of their 
studies, law students are exposed to concepts and ideas taken from other relevant disciplines such as 
Economics, History, Management, Political Science, Psychology, Anthropology/Sociology, Education, and 
Science, and are equipped with essential communication and analytical skills. The LLB phase consists of a 
number of core law courses as prescribed by the Pakistan Bar Council, and a broader range of exciting 
advanced elective courses to deepen skills and expand knowledge of legal fields. The elective courses are 
grouped into subject clusters such as Law, Government and Citizenship, Business Law, Criminal Justice, 
Legal Theory, International & Comparative Law, and others.  In addition, a number of legal writing and 
practice courses, such as Advocacy, Drafting and Opinion Writing, will prepare students for the realities of 
working as a lawyer in Pakistan and abroad.  The law school’s teaching environment is stimulating, 
interactive and innovative. There is ample opportunity to practice and test skills learned in the classroom 
through a range of student-led activities and competitions including mooting and pro-bono work.

SYED AHSAN ALI & SYED MARATIB ALI SCHOOL OF EDUCATION 
Vision 
We seek to operate at the crucial nexus of research, policy and practice, supporting a faculty that is 
internationally competitive, connected, and relevant. The curriculum, featuring extensive field 
engagement, will produce graduates capable of becoming strategic leaders, policy researchers, and 
reflective practitioners, distinctly placed to direct and shape a reimagined and vibrant education reform 
agenda for Pakistan. 
The institution is fueled by the mission to produce future leaders who will Reflect thoughtfully, learn to 
Redefine best practices in education, and collectively Reimagine an education Reform agenda for Pakistan. 
About School 
Syed Ahsan Ali & Syed Maratib Ali School of Education is dedicated to developing strategic leaders and 
change makers within the rapidly expanding educational landscape in Pakistan. The mandated 
comprehensive one-year field experience equips graduates with indispensable skills to become policy 
researchers and reflective practitioners. 
Since its inception, SOE has officially introduced an intensive full-time MPhil Education Leadership and 
Management (ELM) program, as well as an undergraduate minor in Education. The formation of the 
graduate program at SOE ensued from the increasing demand for educational services and the subsequent 
growth of the education sector in Pakistan. There is a dire need for well-trained decision-makers and 
leaders in the sector, such as school principals, school chain managers, policy analysts and implementers, 
and higher education administrators. For this purpose, SOE aims to cultivate a new generation of 
educational leaders who will provide strategic direction to the burgeoning education ecosystem. 
SOE is continuously expanding to address the challenges faced by the education sector. In 2021, the school 
successfully launched an intensive full-time Executive MPhil Education Leadership and Management 
(EELM) weekend program, as well as a specialized stream within the undergraduate minor in Education 
focused on Policy, Politics, and Governance. In 2022, SOE successfully introduced another stream, the 
Undergraduate Minor in Education, with a focus on Curriculum and Instruction. . In 2023, as part of the 
expansion plan, SOE has introduced the new stand-alone minor in Inclusive Education also. 
The school strives to cater to the diverse educational needs of a culturally varied and geographically 
dispersed student body by providing them with academic, professional and personal preparation. This 
opens doors for them to access opportunities that enable them to make a positive impact on the 
educational landscape. 
SOE comprises several important departments that work collaboratively to create a meaningful student 
experience throughout the program. These departments include the Dean's Office, the Academics office, 
the Marketing and Student Services Office, the Partnerships Office, the Career Placement Office, and the 
Professional Education and Policy Engagement Office. 
A crucial aspect of a student's time at SOE is their engagement with professionals in the education sector. 
The school has established partnerships with a network of schools and educational organizations to ensure 
easy access of its students to the professional education landscape. These partnerships facilitate student 
placements for field engagement and ensure student involvement with organizations during the practicum 
module of the graduate coursework. The broad spectrum of educational institutions and organizations 
includes public and private schools, trust schools, for-profit and non-profit organizations, non-formal 
education providers, as well as Madrassah schools. This diverse array of placements aims to create a rich 
and varied learning experience.

determining the student category. 
 
3. Undergraduate Programme Policies 
Students are required to make/follow a study plan in consultation with their faculty advisors/School 
Academic Advisement Units to complete their degree and major requirements.  
The graduation requirements are: 
• 
Successful completion of at least 130 credit hours for the BA-BSc (Honours) programme, 130 to 136 
credit hours for the BS programme, and 162 credit hours for the B.A.-LLB (Honours) programme, taken 

11 
 
over a minimum period of 8 regular semesters (of 16-18 weeks’ duration), summer semesters NOT 
included. For BALLB, completion of a minimum period of 10 regular semesters is mandatory. 
• 
Completion of all the requirements of at least one major/degree programme.

Completion of all LUMS courses satisfying degree requirements with a cumulative grade point average 
(CGPA) of at least 2.00. 
• 
To be a student in good academic and disciplinary standing, and not be involved in any kind of 
investigation. 
 
3.1.   Undergraduate Programme Duration and Structure 
The normal duration of the BA-BSc (Honours) and BS programmes is four years (that is, a minimum of 8 
regular semesters, summer semesters NOT included*). A student can, however, remain enrolled in either 
of these programmes for a maximum of six consecutive calendar years from the date of admission as a 
fresh candidate to LUMS.  
 
The B.A.-LLB (Honours) programme is a five-year joint degree with the first two years in common with other 
undergraduate programmes, followed by a three-year LLB programme. A student can remain enrolled in 
this programme for a maximum of seven consecutive calendar years from the date of admission as a fresh 
candidate to LUMS.  
 
*As per HEC rules, it is mandatory to complete a minimum of eight (8) regular semesters in order to 
graduate with an undergraduate degree. Summer semesters are not counted as these are optional, 
accelerated semesters. 
  
Students who take semester breaks/semester withdrawals or who are given forced semesters off due to a 
disciplinary penalty will have to make up for the time lost by taking additional semesters to ensure that 
that they complete their eight (8) regular semesters or else they will not be allowed to graduate. Hence, 
they are advised to plan their academic journey very carefully in consultation with their respective School 
Academic Advisement Units. 
 
Figure 1 shows the structure of all undergraduate programmes at LUMS. To graduate, students must 
complete the bin-wise courses belonging to the five categories shown below. For details of individual 
programme structure, please refer to Academic Departments and Programme Outlines (Section 2).

[4 Credit Hours] 
SS101  
Islamic Studies (Optional for non-Muslim students)  
[2 Credit Hours] 
SS 102 
Pakistan Studies  
 
 
 
 
[2 Credit Hours] 
 
First year students are required to take University core courses in their first year**. They are pre-registered 
for the courses and cannot drop them. Students requiring an introductory level remedial course before 
taking Writing & Communication are pre-registered in a two-credit hour Introduction to Writing (SS 100A) 
course. 
 
**MGSHSS students, please refer to their school core requirements in Academic Departments and Programme 
Outlines (Section 2). 
 
3.3.   University Distribution Requirements 
In addition to the University core, it is mandatory for each student* to complete the University distribution 
requirements by taking at least seven courses** designated as distribution courses. The distribution 
requirements ensure that students gain wide exposure to other areas in addition to training in an academic 
specialty. 
 
The University Distribution Courses are classified into two broad categories: 
• 
In-Group 
• 
Out-Group 
 
Students are required to complete In-Group and Out-Group requirements according to their degree plans 
in consultation with their School Advising Units.  
 
*The MGSHSS school core requirement adequately covers the University In-Group requirement, hence the 
MGSHSS students are required to complete their three Out-Group distribution requirement only. 
 
**The SBASSE school core requirement adequately covers the University In-Group requirement for Science and 
Engineering students, hence SBASSE students are required to complete their Out-Group distribution requirement

Distribution requirements are met by introductory level* courses (1XX and 2XX) in a subject area. 
Additionally, 3XX and 4XX level courses without pre-requisites also count towards the distribution 
requirement. Distribution courses are for 3 or 4 credit hours. 
 
*MATH 100: Pre-Calculus does not count towards distribution requirements but counts as a free elective. 
 
ECON 100: Principles of Economics counts towards the distribution requirement for Science and 
Engineering students as an Out-Group course. In the case of ACF and LAW, ECON 100 is an In-Group course. 
For Economics, Economics and Mathematics, Political Science and Economics majors, ECON 100 counts as 
a free elective. 
 
For MGSHSS students, all Out-Group courses that are cross listed with their majors will not count as Out-
Group. For further details, please contact the Academic Advising Unit (AAU). 
 
Language (LANG) courses do not count towards distribution requirement. They are letter graded and count 
towards the Free Elective courses’ requirement. 
 
As a general principle, students cannot count a single course towards more than one requirement, except 
as defined in the minor policy. 
 
GSL prefix: Non-Law courses offered under the stream General Studies of Law, with a GSL prefix, will be 
counted towards the free electives for all schools. 
 
4. Registration of Courses 
Semester registration/enrollment is the implementation of the course memo. The course memo is an 
online course catalogue that contains complete information regarding the courses that are offered by the 
respective departments in a semester. It is available well before the commencement of the next semester’s 
enrollment. Students are required to plan their courses according to the information available in the course 
memo and in consultation with their academic advisor/School advisement unit.  
 
4.1.   Course Descriptions 
Course descriptions facilitate students in course selection for the semester. They are provided by the 
respective departments/schools, and include information regarding course material, grading components 
and criteria. They are available in Zambeel before the commencement of enrollment phases of the 
upcoming semester.  
 
4.2.   Course Outlines 
Course outlines are available to students enrolled in those courses via the Learning Management System 
(LMS). These enable the students to understand the detailed requirements of the courses as finalized by 
the instructors. 
 
4.3.   Online Course Evaluations by Students 
Students submit the online course evaluations at the end of each semester, prior to the final examination 
week. During the announced period, the course evaluation forms can be accessed and submitted at 
https://lumseval.lums.edu.pk.   
 

15 
 
The University provides course evaluation information of previous course offerings. This additional 
information further facilitates the students in course selection. The previous course evaluations are 
available at http://portal.lums.edu.pk/RegistrarOffice. 
 
5. Phases of Course Registration 
The semester course registration is processed in two phases, namely, Enrollment Phases I and II. The Office 
of the Registrar publishes the semester course registration deadlines for the academic year, and lists details 
of the process and the respective closure dates for each phase. 
 
Semester enrollment is finalized according to course capacity and eligibility criteria, as defined in the course 
memo by the respective departments/schools. During the phases of semester enrollment, students 
provisionally register in requisite courses through their Zambeel self-service.  
 
5.1.   Enrollment Phase I 
This is a school-specific enrollment where students enroll in core and major elective courses according to 
enrollment appointments for their respective year/level, spread out over a few days. 
 
5.2.  Enrollment Phase II 
This phase is for students to enroll in distribution and free elective courses. Students (all 
levels/majors/schools) add their requests by selecting the waitlist option and enrollment is processed 
according to a random selection. This ensures that all students have an equal chance of enrollment in the 
requested course.  
 
6. Add/Drop and Withdrawal Periods for Regular Courses and Directed Coursework 
 
6.1. Regular Semesters 
For regular semesters, Add/Drop period runs for 11 days, starting from 3 calendar days before the start of 
the semester and continuing till 08 calendar days into the semester. During this period, students may 
Add/Drop courses. It is further divided into following: 
 
6.1.1. Add/drop period through Zambeel 
Students can add, swap, or drop courses through their Zambeel accounts starting from 3 calendar days 
before the start of semester up to 7th day of the semester. 
 
6.1.2. Add Only Day 
After the expiry of add/drop through Zambeel, students have one day (8th day of the semester) on which 
they can only add or swap courses.  
 
6.1.3. Drop Only period* 
This period runs from the 9th day of the semester till the Friday of the 5th week of the semester. Students 
can drop courses up to their specified minimum enrollment limit (Please refer to Section titled Student 
Status and Course Load) 
 
*The Drop Only period is further divided according to course drop charges. For further details, please refer to 
Office of Finance under Section 3: Administrative Offices 
 

16 
 
Course rosters validating the students enrolled in the courses are communicated to the respective 
departments/schools at the end of the Add/Drop period, and again after Drop Only period. Students not 
enrolled in a particular course will not be allowed to attend classes for that course after Add/Drop period, 
or after Drop Only period for courses which they have dropped. Courses dropped within the Add/Drop 
period and Drop Only deadline do not appear on the transcript.  
 
6.1.4. Withdrawal Period 
After the expiry of the Drop Only deadline, students cannot drop but may withdraw from courses till the 
end of the 12th week of a regular semester, as announced in the academic calendar. Students can withdraw 
from courses via their Zambeel Self Service provided they maintain the minimum load requirement of 12 
credit hours. W grade is automatically assigned by the system. 
 
However, under special circumstances, students may be allowed to withdraw from more or all courses 
bringing their total credit hours to below 12. In such cases, the student should route the request to OSA 
with proper documentation as to why this is necessary. Following OSA approval, the student will be 
withdrawn from the necessary courses and W will be assigned to all such courses and visible on the 
transcript. 
 
Please note that within the duration of the undergraduate programme, a student can withdraw from a 
maximum of 6 courses (individually) with a W on transcript, as per defined policy. This condition is not 
applicable when all courses in a semester are withdrawn simultaneously owing to extenuating 
circumstances. The W grade is visible on the student’s transcript and will not be removed even if the 
student successfully completes the course in a subsequent semester. 
 
The fee for a withdrawn course will not be refunded. 
 
After the course withdrawal deadline, as announced in the academic calendar, students do not have the 
option of discontinuing the courses. Discontinuation of a course will result in an F grade, or a grade assigned 
according to the percentage of course instruments attempted. This grade is visible on the transcript and 
will affect the CGPA. 
 
Please note that withdrawing from all courses in a semester is not the same as applying to take a semester 
off before the start of classes. (Please refer to Section: Withdrawals) 
 
6.2. Summer Semester 
Please note that there is no Drop Only period for the Summer semester. After the Add/Drop Period 
deadline, students cannot drop but may withdraw from courses during the Course Withdrawal Period. 
Students can withdraw from courses via their Zambeel Self Service. W grade is automatically assigned by 
the system. Students are advised to consider this before enrolling into the Summer semester. 
Exceptional cases may be catered to with the recommendation of the Office of Student Affairs, subject to 
proper documentation being provided.  
7. Student Status and Course Load  
 
7.1. Regular Semester 
Students are required to take a minimum of 12 credit hours to maintain their regular/active student status. 
First-year students (excluding those in MGSHSS and SBASSE) can take a maximum of 18 credit hours per 

17 
 
semester. MGSHSS first-year students can take a maximum of 16 credit hours per semester, while SBASSE 
first-year students can take a maximum of 18.5 credit hours per semester. Undergraduate students in the 
Sophomore, Junior, and Senior categories can enroll in up to 20 credit hours in a regular semester.  
 
Students are encouraged to consult with their school advisement unit to devise a balanced plan of study 
to complete the graduation requirements in a timely manner. This prevents a situation in which students 
need to take courses over and above the permissible semester limit, to graduate with their cohort. Students 
who end up in this situation will not necessarily be given permission or be granted priority for registering 
in courses. 
 
However, in extreme cases (physical/psychological disability), at the recommendation of the Office of 
Student Support Services, the Office of the Registrar may allow a student to take less than 12 credit hours 
in one or more semesters. The decision is made on a case-to-case basis. Similarly, graduating students 
requiring less than 12 credit hours to graduate can also petition to the Office of the Registrar for taking a 
smaller workload. 
 
Under special circumstances, students may apply to take one course beyond the maximum permitted 
quota of 20 credits in a semester.  Such students are required to have a CGPA of 3.40 or above, or they 
must be seniors who will be able to graduate within the next two semesters with this accommodation. 
These students must inform their school advisement unit and the Office of the Registrar so that they may 
be allowed permission to enroll in the extra credits.  
 
7.2. Summer Semester 
While there is no minimum enrollment limit for the optional Summer semester, students are allowed to 
take a maximum of 8 credits in the Summer semester. 
 
8. Directed Course Work (Courses Requiring Exceptional Method of Registration) 
The undergraduate programme allows students to enrich their independent work/research exposure 
through Directed Course Work. The enrollment procedure for Senior Year Project, Research Project and 
Independent Study varies from the normal method of registration and requires prior approval. For all such 
courses, it is the responsibility of the student to ensure that all the formalities of course registration are 
complete within the deadline specified by the Office of the Registrar. 
 
The different categories for Directed Course Work (DCW) are listed below: 
• 
Independent Study 
• 
Research Project 
• 
Senior Year Project 
• 
Internship 
 
Cumulatively, the Directed Course Work credits (all listed categories included) can be a maximum of 12 
credit hours within the degree tenure. For example, Biology and HSS Senior Projects are of 8 credit hours. 
They are spread as 4+4 credits across two semesters. The students taking these Senior Projects can enroll 
in a maximum of only 4 additional Directed Course Work credit hours (Independent Study, Research 
Project, Internship) in their undergraduate academic career. 
 

18 
 
Students can provisionally register Directed Course Work (Senior Project, Independent Study, etc.) during 
enrollment phases, using their Zambeel self-service. Prior to the registering of courses, the students are 
required to submit a DCW online application in Zambeel. 
 
Applications for DCW registrations open in two rounds in regular semesters as follows: 
 
• 
First round starts 3 weeks before the commencement of Enrollment Phase I 
• 
Second round starts 1 week before commencement of Add/Drop period 
 
Enrollment in Directed Course Work is confirmed once the online application is approved by the respective 
department coordinator, faculty supervisor and verified by the Office of the Registrar. 
 
Directed Course Work grades submission deadline is within the semester absolute grading deadline. If the 
DCW grade is pending, instructor can assign ‘I’ grade. After the semester absolute grading deadline, a list 
of students with ‘I’ grade is sent to the respective department coordinator, instructor, and students, 
mentioning the 6 weeks’ deadline (after the absolute grading deadline). In case the grade is not received 
by this deadline, two weeks’ extension deadline is communicated. After this buffer, an ‘F’ is assigned in the 
system. 
 
Opting for Directed Course Work remotely: 
The following policy applies if a student wants to register for Directed Course Work, while on 
visiting/exchange programme in another University or the supervisor is not on campus: 
 
• 
The student must seek prior approval from the respective faculty supervisor. 
• 
The school/department will decide whether to allow/deny the distant DCW registration. 
• 
In case the student is on an exchange programme, the student will have two supervisors, one in LUMS 
and one at the institute that the student is attending on an exchange programme.  
• 
Students will present the DCW twice, once while on exchange and again on return to LUMS. 
• 
A final grade is awarded by the respective department once both (external & internal) evaluations are 
complete. 
• 
On intimation from the department, the Office of the Registrar uploads the final grade of the student 
in the system. 
• 
For remote DCW during an exchange semester, the respective semester term is activated, and the fee 
is charged accordingly. Students must apply for a semester off before leaving for exchange for record 
purposes. 
• 
Students participating in the remote/distant DCW during an exchange semester need not be in a group. 
It could be taken individually.  
 
8.1.   Senior Project (SPROJ) 
During the Senior year, students can opt for a Senior Project (SPROJ) under the guidance of a faculty 
supervisor. SPROJ provides students with the opportunity to use their foundational academic skills and 
content knowledge to gain new, deeper levels of understanding. The project must challenge the student’s 
ability and the chosen topic needs to be of significant value to the student, the school, and the community. 
This directed learning experience involves thinking analytically, logically, and creatively integrating 
experience and knowledge to form reasoned judgements and solve problems that will help direct future 
career and educational opportunities. 

19 
 
Important points to consider while opting for SPROJ: 
• 
Senior Project (SPROJ) can be taken in either or both last two regular semesters. 
• 
In case the SPROJ is spread over two semesters, the student must enroll for SPROJ A in the Fall semester 
and SPROJ B in the Spring semester of the final year of the degree programme. 
• 
If the SPROJ is spread over two semesters and the student enrolls in SPROJ A in the Spring semester 
and SPROJ B in the Summer semester, then the student is eligible to attend the convocation next year, 
subject to the completion of degree requirements.  
• 
Senior Project can only be taken for the whole duration of summer semesters (8 weeks). 
• 
A student can take only one SPROJ during his/her degree programme tenure. 
• 
A student can enroll in maximum 4 credit hours’ SPROJ in a single semester. 
• 
SPROJ is letter graded. 
• 
Senior Project can range from 3 to 6 credit hours depending on the scope/rigor defined by the 
respective department/school, exceptionally (BIO, HSS & LAW) SPROJ can be of 8 (4+4) credit hours.  
• 
ECON SPROJ can be of 4 (one semester) or 8 (two semesters) credit hours. 
• 
If it is a 6-credit hour SPROJ, then it is split as SPROJ A and SPROJ B, with the respective assigned codes. 
It is 3+3 credits over two semesters. However, depending on the rigor involved, it can be 4+4, to be 
completed in two semesters. 
• 
If SPROJ is spread across two semesters, then it is evaluated once completed and the assigned letter 
grade is uploaded for SPROJ A and B (unless defined by the department). 
• 
SPROJ group members generally range from 2-8 (not individually) depending upon the complexity and 
workload approved by the respective department/school. 
• 
Depending on the programme structure, Senior Project can be mandatory or optional. 
• 
In the case of optional SPROJ, if the student chooses a Senior Project with a major area of study 
relevant to his/her declared major, it counts towards the respective major elective requirement. If the 
student chooses a SPROJ with a major area of study different from his/her declared major, it counts 
towards free elective requirement. 
• 
Economics SPROJ counts towards free electives.  
• 
The SPROJ prefix for registration is according to the area of study. 
If a group of students choose an SPROJ area different from their declared major, they need to include 
at least one member in the group with a declared major relevant to the SPROJ chosen area. For 
example, if students majoring in Economics wish to do SPROJ in ACF, then at least one group member 
should be an ACF major. Such students are also required to select two supervisors: one from their own 
area of study and the other from the selected SPROJ area. Such SPROJ applications are approved by 
the latter supervisor.  
• 
In case, if an SPROJ is not a major core requirement and the credits go in the free electives bin then 
the requirement of a co-supervisor is not mandatory while pursuing an SPROJ across schools. Such 
students can do an individual SPROJ outside their major/department with the approval of the 
department/school with which they are pursuing the SPROJ.  
 
Note: If the Senior Project is to be completed in two semesters, then the final grade for SPROJ A & B 
(registered in two consecutive semesters) is assigned at the end of the second semester. In the interim, 
there will be no grade assigned for SPROJ A. 
 
In case a multi term project is not completed within the absolute grading deadline for the former term in 
which SPROJ B was enrolled, then an I grade may be assigned if 90% of the coursework is complete.  
 

20 
 
8.2.   Independent Study (IS) 
Independent Study is an individual effort to study a particular area in Senior year. It may be opted to 
complete a student’s degree requirements, in case an alternate/appropriate course in that subject area is 
not offered in that academic year. Students who opt for an Independent Study will individually complete 
the requirements under the supervision of an assigned faculty member. They will have to take an exam or 
submit a report at the end of the semester in order to secure a Pass grade in the Independent Study. 
 
Important points to consider while opting for Independent Study: 
• 
A student who has attained Senior status can register for an Independent Study of at most 2 credit 
hours in a semester, only in case there is no regular course available to fulfil the credit hour or area 
requirement. 
• 
Students within the allowed programme tenure can take a maximum of 4 Independent Study credit 
hours (spread over two semesters) towards the completion of their Bachelor’s degree requirements. 
•

(2) credit hour independent study can be taken for the whole duration of summer semester. 
• 
Independent Study can be done only individually and not in a group. 
• 
Independent Study is graded Pass/Fail. 
• 
A Failing grade will affect the CGPA with no credit given, while a Pass grade will contribute towards the 
earned credits and will not affect the CGPA. 
 
8.3.   Directed Research Project (DRP) 
In the Junior year, students can opt for a Directed Research Project individually or in a group. Students are 
enrolled with a supervisor to mentor the project and guide the students to use their creativity, initiative, 
and develop the research skills needed for further study or work. Upon successful completion, students 
can take their research further as a Senior Year Project for deeper level of understanding. 
 
Important points to consider while opting for Directed Research Project: 
• 
A student who has attained Junior/Senior status can register for a Directed Research Project of at most 
2 credit hours in a semester. 
• 
Students can take a maximum of 4 DRP credit hours towards the completion of their Bachelor’s degree 
requirements, within the allowed programme tenure. 
• 
One (1) credit hour DRP can be taken in either or both summer sessions. Or at most two (2) credit hour 
DRP can be taken for the whole duration of Summer semester.

8.4.   ACF Internship 
ACF Internship (duration: 6-8 Weeks) is a mandatory degree requirement for ACF major students. However, 
doing an internship is optional for MGS majors. It is a supervised work experience that provides valuable 
educational exposure to augment the academic learning of a student. A student may work as an intern for 
profit and non-profit sectors to earn specified academic credits. ACF internships offer students a hands-on 
opportunity to work in their desired field. They learn how their course of study applies to the real world, 
making them stronger candidates for jobs after graduation. 
 

21 
 
Important points to consider while opting for ACF Internship: 
• 
ACF internship is a mandatory degree requirement for all ACF students. Students earn four semester 
credit hours on successful completion of the internship. 
• 
ACF Internship is graded as Pass/Fail. 
• 
A Failing grade will affect the CGPA with no credits given while a Pass grade will contribute towards 
the earned credits and will not affect the CGPA. 
 
9. Courses that Require a Separate Mention 
The following courses have different grading/evaluation criteria. 
 
9.1. Remedial Course in Writing & Communication 
The University, following its process, may require certain students to improve their English comprehension 
and communication skills by taking a remedial course SS 100A Introduction to Writing (IW). The following 
rules apply in this case: 
• 
Students requiring IW are pre-enrolled on the department/school’s recommendation in this course, in 
their first Fall semester. 
• 
IW is a two-credit hour course. Students are advised to plan their semester workload in such a way 
that they are well able to focus on this remedial course. 
• 
IW counts towards Free Elective courses as specified in the degree requirement. 
• 
It is letter graded.  
• 
Students who fail this remedial course in the Fall are required to retake it in Spring the next time it is 
offered. In case of a second failure, the students are required to take IW a third time, in the next Fall. 
• 
A third failure will result in the student’s separation from the programme. 
• 
Students who pass SS 100A are eligible to take SS 100 in the next semester. 
 
9.2. Language Courses 
The University offers many language courses. The following rules apply in the case of language courses: 
• 
Language courses are offered in the prefix LANG. 
• 
They are letter graded. 
• 
Language courses do not count towards the distribution requirement. 
• 
They count as Free Elective courses as specified in the degree requirement. 
 
9.3. Waiver for Islamic Studies 
Non-Muslim students are exempted from taking Islamic Studies, which is a core course for all 
undergraduate programmes. These students can take the specified course/Independent study approved 
as a substitute by the HSS department.  Please contact your school’s advisement unit for further 
information.  
 
10.   Pre-Requisites of Courses 
The enrollment phases for the next semester commence prior to the final examinations of the current 
semester. 
 
The registration system recognizes whether the pre-requisite course has been taken by the student or is 
in-progress.  Ideally, all pre-requisite requirements for a course should be met before registering for the 
course. This may not be possible if a course and its pre-requisite course are offered in consecutive 

22 
 
semesters and the result of the pre-requisite has not been declared at the time of registration. In the event 
that the student fails the pre-requisite course, it is his responsibility to drop the subsequent course unless 
permission has been obtained from the school’s advisement unit to continue with the course and repeat 
the pre-requisite course at a later stage. 
 
Pre-requisite and subsequent courses (co-requisites) cannot be taken together in a semester. 
 
11.  Cross-listed Courses 
Some courses are listed in more than one subject area with separate course codes for the relevant areas. 
A student may register for the course with only one prefix and the course will count towards the chosen 
area for the duration of the programme. The chosen course code will not be changed in Zambeel after the 
Add/Drop period. Students should carefully select the correct prefix while registering in cross-listed 
courses. Cross-listed courses cannot be re-labelled with a different prefix on the transcript. 
 
12.  Course Repeat and Replace Policy 
Students may repeat courses with grade replacement. The grade of both the attempts are visible on the 
transcript but only the best grade is included in the term and cumulative grade point average (CGPA) 
calculations.  
 
• 
Students have the option to repeat a course if they have obtained C- or below (including F) grade. 
• 
Best grade counts in the CGPA calculation. The credits of repeated courses count once towards 
successfully completed credit hours, but all grades are visible on the transcript. 
• 
Students who repeat a course in which they have obtained a C or above grade will fall under all grades 
count policy. 
• 
The course grade is replaced only if the same course is repeated. Exception to this rule is only given by 
the head of department/programme director, provided the course repeated for replacement is 
substantially similar to the original course. This exception is applicable only in case the original course 
(core/mandatory course for graduation) is not being offered again by the department. 
• 
Repeated courses do not count towards honours and awards, throughout the degree tenure. 
• 
Students who receive an F grade in a core course must repeat it as a graduation requirement. 
 
12.1. 
Policy for Thrice Failure in a Core Course 
A student has a maximum of two attempts to clear an F grade in a core course inclusive of University Core, 
School Core, and Major core. The courses which are outside of these categories but are designated as core 
courses that form part of the graduation requirements for a particular major, will also fall under this thrice 
failure policy and a student failing such a course three times will be separated from the university. If 
separated for the first time, such students can apply for readmission and readmission conditions under the 
section ‘Academic Standing’ will apply.  
 
13.  Course Audit 
Course auditing implies that students can sit through classes but are not eligible to participate actively in 
class discussions and assignments, nor can they take midterm and/or final examinations. No grade shall be 
assigned to the student. Other details are: 
 
• 
Audited courses do not appear on the transcript. 
• 
There is no separate University certificate for course audit. 

23 
 
• 
To audit the course, students must apply to the Office of the Registrar on the prescribed form available 
at http://portal.lums.edu.pk/RegistrarOffice. The course audit forms must be submitted by the 7th day 
of the semester. In case of Summer semester, which is compressed, forms should be submitted by the 
first day of classes. 
• 
Permission is granted on a first-come first-serve basis, depending upon the availability of seats in the 
course. 
• 
Certain courses may be closed for auditing at the request of the instructor. 
• 
Students may audit courses in a semester even if they have taken the semester off. 
• 
Students cannot audit courses if they have been separated from the University and await readmission. 
• 
Students may take the course as a regular course after auditing it in a previous semester. 
• 
Auditing a course does not merit availing any University facility. Such students are not provided with 
hostel accommodation. 
• 
Students wishing to audit a course are required to pay the requisite fee. (Please refer to the Office of 
Finance for further details). 
 
14.  Course Cancellation 
Following the University guidelines and as communicated by the respective departments/schools, the 
Office of the Registrar processes the cancellation of courses offered in a semester. This decision may be 
taken at any time during initial course registration or Add/Drop period. 
 
15. Major Declaration and Allocation Process for First year students 
Students are required to give preferences for major declaration at the end of the first year. MGSHSS 
students can declare their major at the end of sophomore year. This is an indication that they have spent 
a year (or two as for MGSHSS) at the University in their admitted school/programme and wish to continue 
as such for the rest of their stay at LUMS, intending to graduate with their allocated major. Major 
declaration preferences are submitted through Zambeel at the end of Spring semester each year. In case 
first year students wish to change their school/programme, they have the option to apply for the change 
simultaneously with major declaration. The students are required to submit their online application along 
with the completed documents listed in Section 15.5 below. 
 
The major allocation decisions are based on the criteria/requirements as defined by the respective 
departments/schools, listed in Section 15.1 through 15.4. These decisions are communicated to the 
students by the Office of the Registrar. The major allocation process is completed by mid-July. 
 
The allocation of a major is based on the student’s cumulative grade point average (CGPA), available space 
and the fulfilment of any other requirements laid down by the respective departments. The student is 
assigned a major at the end of the Spring semester of first year or as specified by respective school. Summer 
semester CGPA is not included in major allocation.

3.3 in CS 100, CS 200, CS 202, MATH 101 and MATH 120. 
 
Once first year students have been assigned a major, they are re-assigned faculty advisors in their majors. 
Major-relevant academic advisors are better suited to guide them in their subsequent studies, formulate a 
stepwise course plan and help them choose a career. The approval of these advisors must be obtained for 
appropriate course registration in the following years. 
 
15.4. 
SAHSOL First Year Students Undertaking Submission 
SAHSOL first year students are admitted to the Law programme as Law majors from the first day at LUMS. 
The Law students re-declare their major as Law by submitting undertaking through their Zambeel self-
service at the end of the first year. In case Law students wish to change their school/programme at the end 
of the first year, the availability of space and cut off CGPA criteria in addition to rules/requirements defined 
by the prospective school/department apply. Students wishing to transfer into the Law programme need 
to take Law 101 and Law 102 before applying for a transfer.  Acceptance into the programme will be subject 
to the availability of seats and other criteria established by SAHSOL administration.

declaration/allocation and school/major change (if applicable) at the end of the First year, a change in 
school/major is allowed only once during the remaining tenure of the degree programme. 
 
For this subsequent school change, a non-refundable processing fee of Rs. 30,000 is charged.  
 
University policy for NOP students and students availing financial aid will apply in case of school/major 
transfer. 
 
In case of inter-school/inter-programme transfer across all schools/majors:  
• 
All grades count in the CGPA. 
• 
The roll number is changed according to the programme requirement. 
 
16. Joint Major 
Joint majors provide the richness of two undergraduate major areas. Currently, the University offers Joint 
Majors in Politics and Economics, and Economics and Mathematics. The degree requirements for Joint 
Majors are defined and completed within the minimum 130-credit hour undergraduate degree completion 
requirement. 
 
17.  Double Major 
After having declared a major, students may opt for a second major (space and fulfilment of other 
requirements permitting) in their Junior/Senior year, (for SBASSE, no later than the start of sixth semester) 
after due consultation with their faculty advisors. Completion of requirements of both majors does not 
automatically allow a student to claim a double major degree without declaring it beforehand in a timely 
manner. 
 
Students need to fulfil the following requirements for a double major: 
• 
Successful completion of minimum 160 credit hours. 
• 
Students pursuing a double major need to complete the University core and the University distribution 
requirements according to the primary declared major. 
• 
The students are required to complete the core and elective requirements of their primary major. 
• 
They also must complete the core and elective requirements of their secondary chosen major. 
• 
Students must take free electives to complete the minimum degree requirement of 160 credit hours. 
• 
The students are required to have a minimum CGPA of 2.50 at the time of declaring a second major, 
apart from SBASSE, where the minimum requirement is 3.00. 
• 
The maximum time allowed to complete the requirements of the double major is six years from the 
year of admission at LUMS. 
• 
Students wishing to pursue a double major need to fill the double major declaration form available at 
the Office of the Registrar portal: http://portal.lums.edu.pk/RegistrarOffice. 
• 
Students enrolled in B.A.-LLB (Honours) Programme are not allowed to opt for a double major. This 
also applies to students enrolled in other schools who wish to opt for a double major in SAHSOL. 
 
For further information on Double Major at SBASSE (both inbound/outbound students), please see Section 2: 
Academic Departments and Programme Outlines. 
 

27 
 
18. Minor Declaration 
A University minor serves to broaden students’ horizons and expand the range of options available to them. 
Students can complement the study of the major by selecting a minor in an adjacent or related area, 
thereby sharpening their understanding and deepening the knowledge acquired in their principal area of 
specialization. A minor can also serve as a basis for and facilitate interdisciplinary study and inquiry. 
Students also have the option of selecting a minor in an area completely unrelated to their major and can 
elect to explore areas of interest by selecting a discipline much farther afield. Students are in no way 
constrained or restricted in their choice of a minor and are not obliged to justify their selection by 
demonstrating its relevance to a particular field or area of specialization.

18.1. 
Rules for Minors 
The following rules are applicable to Minors at LUMS: 
1. Students intending to minor in a particular area of study should select from the list of minors approved 
by the University. 
2. Students intending to complete a minor should successfully complete a minimum of 6 regular courses, 
carrying 3 or 4 credits each (for a total ranging from 18 to 24 credit hours), in some combination of 
required core courses (100, 200 level) and electives. 

28 
 
3. Senior Projects, Independent Studies, or courses with fewer than 3 credits do not count towards the 
minor. 
4. Students intending to complete a minor should achieve a minimum GPA of 2.75 in that area of study 
(in the six or more courses that make up the minor). 
5. Students intending to minor in a particular area cannot count a 100-level course as an elective. 
6. Students intending to minor in an area of study must complete at least two electives at the 300 level 
or higher in that area. 
7. The (three) courses that make up the University core, Writing & Communication, Pakistan Studies, and 
Islamic Studies cannot contribute towards the minor. 
8. Of the courses that satisfy the In-Group and Out-Group requirements, no more than one can be used 
to fulfil the requirements for the minor. 
9. A course that is cross listed with another discipline can satisfy the requirements for a major or a minor 
but cannot be counted twice. 
10. Students intending to minor in an area in SSE cannot count more than one SSE core course towards 
the minor. 
11. Politics and Economics (joint major) cannot minor in either Politics or Economics. 
12. Pass/Fail courses do not count towards fulfilment of a minor.  
13. Economics and Mathematics (joint major) cannot minor in either Economics or Mathematics. 
14. The minor requirements can be completed within the credit limit of 130/138 by following a carefully 
chalked course plan and by taking appropriate courses as free electives to count towards the minor. 
These students might need to take additional credit hours for the completion of the minor 
requirements. 
15. The minor will only be displayed on the final transcript, NOT on the degree. 
16. Students will not be given preference in course enrollment based on their minor requirements. 
17. The minor is a look back option and should be declared only at the time of graduation, once the 
graduation 
requirements 
are 
fulfilled, 
by 
submitting 
the 
minor 
form 
available 
at 
https://zambeel.lums.edu.pk. A student cannot declare a minor once the GAF has been submitted as 
the transcript is already finalized and hence cannot be changed.  
 
All schools have additional requirements for minors, and students intending to pursue a minor must ensure 
that they acquaint themselves with the policy regarding minors as defined by the respective schools.  
 
For further details, please refer to Section 2: Academic Departments and Programme Outlines. 
 
19. Withdrawals 
 
Withdrawals are broadly categorized as: 
1. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University and programme results in the permanent cancellation of 
the student’s active status at LUMS.  
2. Semester off from the campus results in withdrawal from that semester only and deactivation of the 
student’s enrolled status for that semester. 
3. Withdrawal from all courses in a semester, approved by OSA, owing to extenuating circumstances, 
within the drop only deadline, without ‘W’ grades on the transcript. 
4. Withdrawal from all courses in a semester, approved by OSA, owing to extenuating circumstances, 
within the withdrawal deadline, resulting in all ‘W’ grades on the transcript for that particular 
semester. 
5. Withdrawal from a course in a semester resulting in a ‘W’ grade on the transcript for that particular 
course. 
 

29 
 
Note: Withdrawing from all courses in a semester is NOT equivalent to taking a semester off. 
 
19.1. 
Voluntary Withdrawal from the University and Programme 
Students may withdraw voluntarily from the University/programme at any time during the semester. 
Students wishing to withdraw must inform their faculty advisor in person and submit an online application 
via their Zambeel self-service, citing the reason for withdrawal. A system-generated notification is sent to 
relevant offices of the University as necessary. The online clearance process is initiated by the Office of the 
Registrar and the student is required to follow this process, starting with the return of the LUMS Smart 
card to the Campus Security department. 
 
Once this process is concluded and the student’s university withdrawal request is approved, the student’s 
status is permanently deactivated, and the student is no longer deemed a regular student at LUMS. A 
student who withdraws from the university is eligible to apply afresh or as a transfer student. In the case 
of a transfer student, the student must take admission in another HEC- recognized institution and complete 
one year of study before applying to LUMS. 
 
19.2. 
Semester off from Campus 
Students may plan to take a regular semester off by submitting an online application via their Zambeel self-
service and in consultation with their faculty advisor/school advising unit. In order that this application may 
be acknowledged and processed by the aforementioned authorities in time, the last day to apply for this 
will be the day before the commencement of classes for that semester. In case no application is received, 
and student is not enrolled in courses, it would be treated as Unauthorized Withdrawal.  
 
• 
The probationary status of a student remains the same on re-joining LUMS after taking a semester off. 
• 
Taking a semester off may result in a delay in graduation up to a year or even more. 
• 
In case of structured programmes, taking a semester off is discouraged and should be done after 
consulting the school’s advising unit. 
• 
A student cannot take more than two consecutive regular semesters off. 
• 
First year students are not allowed to withdraw from their first semester. 
• 
Any semesters taken off will be included in the required degree completion time limit. It is the 
student’s responsibility to complete the degree requirements within the specified time for the 
respective programme.  
 
As the summer semester is optional, there is no need for students to apply for a semester off. 
 
19.3. 
Withdrawal from all courses in a semester  
In extreme emergencies, students can voluntarily withdraw from a semester till the last day of course 
withdrawal period (as mentioned in the university timeline) , provided there are medical grounds or 
circumstances beyond their control. Students are required to submit the online withdrawal application via 
their Zambeel self-service and upload proper documentation as mentioned below:  
a) In the case of circumstances beyond students' control (such as family emergencies or financial 
hardships, etc.), supporting documents must be uploaded to verify the issue. These documents could 
include letters from family members, legal documents, or any other relevant evidence to substantiate the 
claim. 
b) For medical or health-related issues, students are required to submit treating physician or psychiatrist 
prescription and recommendation to justify their need for withdrawal. This could involve medical 

30 
 
recommendation, treatment plans, or any other medical documentation supporting the student's 
condition and its impact on their ability to continue with their studies.  
These documents are then verified by the Office of Student Affairs (OSA), which approves or declines the 
application. If the documentation provided is based on misrepresentation, it is treated as a serious 
disciplinary matter and the student can be separated from the university. Students on probation, who are 
allowed to withdraw from a semester, can resume their studies in the following semester with their 
probationary status unchanged. 
Once an application for withdrawal is approved, the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) issues a withdrawal 
letter to the student. In some cases, students with medical or health-related issues may be granted a 
withdrawal with conditions for rejoining. 
For details on the rejoining procedure, please refer to the section| Rejoining Process for Semester 
Withdrawals on Health Grounds. 
Note: The degree completion time criterion is not relaxed 
 
19.4. 
Withdrawal from a course in a semester  
Students may withdraw from courses till the end of the 12th week of a regular semester, as announced in 
the academic calendar. Students can withdraw from courses via their Zambeel Self Service provided they 
maintain the minimum load requirement of 12 credit hours. “W” grade is automatically assigned by the 
system.   
 
19.5. 
Involuntary Withdrawal  
In extreme cases, the University may insist on a student's involuntary withdrawal from the semester or the 
program if, according to the judgment of the University Officials, the student: 
• 
Poses a threat to the lives or safety of themselves or other members of the LUMS community. 
• 
Has a medical/psychological condition that could likely worsen due to the academic and/or living 
environment at LUMS. 
• 
Exhibits behavior stemming from a medical/psychological condition that seriously interferes with 
their own education and that of other LUMS community members. 
• 
The involuntary withdrawal process is initiated after thorough verification by the school's Advising 
Unit, student counselor, and other relevant University officials. 
 
19.5.1. 
 Involuntary Withdrawal from the University 
On processing of the involuntary withdrawal, the student status is permanently deactivated, and the 
student is no longer deemed a regular LUMS student. 
 
19.5.2. 
 Involuntary Withdrawal from the Semester 
In cases where students are determined to be capable of recovery or coping, they are given involuntary 
semester withdrawal. Such students are allowed to rejoin after that specific period based on their 
compliance with the rejoining conditions and verification by the OSA. 
For further details on the rejoining procedure, please refer to section | Rejoining Process for Semester 
Withdrawals on Health Grounds. 
Note: The degree completion time criterion is not relaxed. 

31 
 
19.6. 
Rejoining Process for Semester Withdrawals on Health Grounds 
Due to health reasons, OSA may give students a semester withdrawal with rejoining conditions. Such 
students, when planning to rejoin, are required to submit treatment documentation and an academic plan 
approved by the school's advising unit to the OSA at least two weeks prior to the start of the semester they 
wish to rejoin. These requirements are verified by the OSA, and upon successful verification 
documentation, students are required to undergo an in-person or online rejoining assessment facilitated 
by either the Counselling and Psychological Services (CAPS) or the LUMS Medical Center (LMC), coordinated 
via the OSA. Upon successful completion of the above steps and recommendation received by CAPS/LMC, 
and upon OSA approval the Office of Registrar may allow the student to resume studies.    
19.6.1 Conditional Rejoining 
In cases where it was not possible for the above-mentioned offices/departments to conduct an online 
rejoining assessment of the student due to connectivity issues at the student's end, specifically because of 
their geographical location, the OSA will allow conditional rejoining for the student to enroll in the next 
semester. Once the student has been assessed by LMC/CAPS, only then will their rejoining be confirmed 
or denied. An email will be sent to such students to undergo mandatory assessment session during 
add/drop week from OSA or else their enrolment will get jeopardized. In case of noncompliance, students 
will be forcefully withdrawn from the semester and the rejoining conditions will remain. 
19.7. 
Unauthorized Withdrawal 
Students who leave the University without prior permission to withdraw are considered to have resigned 
and their admission stands cancelled. 
 
A maximum of 3 attempts are made via email and a letter to contact such students who are absent from 
the University without prior information. Students are asked to enroll in their courses within the enrollment 
period or to take a semester off.  
 
Finally, a warning letter and an email is issued to students stating that they are required to complete 
documentation to take the semester off. If they fail to respond within one week of issuance of this third 
warning, they are issued an unauthorized withdrawal letter from the programme. 
In case it comes into university’s knowledge that a LUMS student is simultaneously enrolled in another 
degree programme, he/she will be separated from LUMS with immediate effect. 
 
20. Transfer Students 
The following policy holds in case of transfer from other recognized institutions to LUMS undergraduate 
programme: 
• 
Of the total graduation requirement of 130 credit hours, at least 72 credit hours must be completed at 
LUMS. 
• 
If credit is given for courses taken at other educational institutions, then credit hours for these courses 
count towards the graduation requirement as well as major and/or minor requirements. A maximum 
of 58 credit hours can be transferred but the grades obtained in the completion of these credit hours 
are not used in the computation of the CGPA at LUMS. 
• 
The Admissions Committee decides the credit limit that can be transferred to LUMS.  
• 
Like other undergraduate students at LUMS, transfer students must graduate within a maximum of six 
consecutive calendar years from the date of admission. This duration is reduced by one calendar year 
for every 30 credit hours transferred to LUMS. 

32 
 
• 
The number of credit hours transferred and those completed at LUMS are used to determine student 
category, for example, first year student or sophomore. 
• 
Upon admission to LUMS, for a transfer of credits, the student must submit the official, attested course 
outlines for courses taken at the previous institution to the Office of Admissions. Mere submission of 
course descriptions and reading material will not be accepted for course evaluation in lieu of proper 
course outlines. These are then forwarded to the Office of the Registrar for instructors’ evaluations 
within respective departments. Transfer of credits can only be processed after approvals from the 
concerned departments, subject to satisfying the University defined guidelines below: 
o 
Course outline/content matching equivalent course at LUMS. 
o 
Classroom contact hours. 
o 
Assignment rigour. 
• 
Only courses with B and above grades are eligible for transfer, if approved.  
• 
Only grade C and above that is achieved in courses taken at LUMS will be transferred for external 
incoming students. To ensure that the rigour of courses is upheld, if somebody takes up a course and 
gets into LUMS in the following year (next year), it will be at the discretion of the department/school 
to evaluate and decide whether the course content is still up-to-date and valid for a transfer. The 
credits of these courses are included in the completed credits, whereas the course grades are neither 
visible on the transcript nor included in the CGPA calculation. 
• 
A course can only be transferred if evaluated as equivalent to a course offered at LUMS. Credit given 
for the courses taken before admission to LUMS will not count towards the semester credit limit 
required for End of the Year awards. 
• 
A transfer student can request a re-evaluation of his/her course outline by sending an email to RO till 
the first week of the Add/Drop period of that semester. After Add/Drop, no student is allowed to 
request a second round of re-evaluation of the course outlines. 
 
20.1. Transferred Credits for Courses Taken at Institutions under the LUMS Exchange 
Programme 
Exchange programmes provide an opportunity for LUMS students to study abroad and for foreign students 
to study at LUMS. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) at LUMS manages student exchange programmes 
with specific universities renowned throughout the world. Details of these programmes are periodically 
announced to the student body at LUMS, and they are encouraged to apply. For more information, please 
refer to the section Office of International Affairs under Section 3: Administrative Offices 
 
Before leaving, students should look at the courses they wish to take at the institution they will be visiting 
as exchange students. Ideally, detailed outlines should be submitted to the Office of International Affairs 
for onwards submission to the relevant LUMS departments for evaluation prior to leaving. Once approved, 
the Office of International Affairs must inform the Office of the Registrar, so these credits can be counted 
towards the degree requirements. Also, before proceeding, visiting/exchange students are required to 
inform the Office of the Registrar and apply for semester-off for the period they intend to take courses 
outside LUMS. The application is submitted on the approved form within the communicated deadline. 
Students may apply for semester off by submitting an online application via their Zambeel self-service. 
 
Respective departments follow the below defined University criteria for course evaluation: 
• 
Course outline/content matching an equivalent course at LUMS. 
• 
Classroom contact hours. 
• 
Assignment rigour. 

33 
 
 
On successful completion of the exchange programme students can apply for credit transfer, as per the 
evaluated course outlines, through the Office of the Registrar after submitting the hardcopy of the 
transcript of the exchange programme at Office of International Affairs (OIA). 
 
Only courses with B and above grade are transferred. The credits of these courses are included in the 
completed credits, whereas the course grades are not included in the CGPA calculation. The maximum 
number of credits that can be transferred in one semester is equal to the credits which a student can take 
in a semester at LUMS.  
 
The exchange students are charged as ‘fee-per-credit-hour’. Credit hours are awarded to their courses after 
the pre-evaluation process has taken place, before students’ departures, irrespective of the number of 
credit hours transferred upon their return. The following table covers the different scenarios related to the 
policy:

In the event when a student drops a course, before taking classes or at the start of the semester, at the 
host institution (during the Add/Drop period), OIA informs RO and Finance Office to keep an updated 
record. Hence, students are charged for courses/credits that they finally enroll in as per scenarios provided 
in the table below:

A standard tuition fee of 16 Credit Hours is charged to the Outgoing International Exchange Students. If a 
student enrolls in less than or more than 16 credit hours at their host university, the fee is adjusted 
accordingly as per the pre-evaluated credit hours. If a student enrolls in more than 16 credit hours, they 
receive an additional fee voucher during the same semester. However, if the student enrolls in less than 
16 credit hours then the adjustment is made in the following semester. 
 
Credits taken during the exchange programme count towards the semester credits requirement for the 
End of the Year awards. In case, students qualify for the End of Year Awards, awards at the time of 
graduation and for top positions (based on the number of credits), only then, grades of the transferred 
courses are taken into consideration towards the CGPA/SCGPA requirement of equal to or greater than 
3.60. This is to ensure that the university defined CGPA/SCGPA awards’ criteria is maintained. 
 

34 
 
Grades of the courses transferred will not be shown on the transcript or count towards the Semester 
GPA/CGPA/SCGPA. 
 
20.2. 
Transferred Credits for Courses Taken by LUMS Students at Other Institutions 
Before leaving, students must obtain prior approval to take courses at other institutions as visiting 
students. This is done by providing the detailed course outlines to their School Dean’s office for onwards 
submission to the respective departments for evaluation. Once approved, the School Dean’s office must 
inform the Office of the Registrar so these credits can be counted towards the degree requirements. 
 
It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that s/he takes only the approved courses at the host institution, 
to avoid rejection of course credit transfer by the respective departments, based on the course content 
provided later. Credits for these courses are transferred to LUMS subject to meeting the criteria of B grade 
or above. On successful completion of the visiting semester, students can apply for credit transfer as per 
the evaluated course outlines, through the Office of the Registrar after submitting the hardcopy of 
transcript at RO. 
 
Credits taken as visiting students count towards the semester credits requirement for the End of the Year 
awards. In case, students qualify for the End of Year Awards, awards at the time of graduation and for top 
positions (based on the number of credits), only then, grades of the transferred courses are taken into 
consideration towards the CGPA/SCGPA requirement of equal to or greater than 3.60. This is to ensure that 
the university defined CGPA/SCGPA awards’ criteria is maintained. 
 
Graduating seniors wishing to take their final semester abroad are strongly advised to ensure that the 
courses they plan to take at the other institution will satisfy their remaining graduation requirements at 
LUMS. A failure to do so may result in a delay in graduation. 
 
General Credit Transfer Guidelines applicable to all kinds of exchange programmes: 
i. 
If the course taken at another university is equivalent to a course in LUMS, it is transferred as 
equivalent to that course. Whereas, if the course is not exactly equivalent but has overlapping content, 
then it is transferred as a TC (Transferred course) and counts towards free elective requirements.  
ii. 
If a student has taken a 4 credit hours course at another university and the course is worth 3 credit 
hours at LUMS or vice versa, the minimum of the two will be transferred. If a core course of 4 credit 
has been give full credit by instructor after evaluation but the student has taken the course as 3 credit 
hours at the host university, the course will be transferred as 3 credit hour and 1 credit hour will be 
fulfilled by Independent Study. 
iii. 
The courses evaluated with fractional credit hours i.e., 2.5/3.5 etc. are rounded off to the nearest 
whole number. 
iv. 
The maximum number of credits that can be transferred in one semester is equal to the credits which 
a student is allowed to take in a semester at LUMS. 
v. 
In case a transcript represents grades as ‘Excellent’, ‘Very good’, ‘Good’ or ‘Satisfactory’, for transfer 
of credits only ‘Excellent’ and ‘Very Good’ grades meet the eligibility criteria of B or above grade and 
are transferred accordingly. 
vi. 
Pass/Fail graded courses are NOT transferred. 
Grades of the courses transferred will not be shown on the transcript or count towards the Semester 
GPA/CGPA/SCGPA. 
 

35 
 
21. Academic Performance 
Course grades are visible to the students in their Zambeel self-service once they are finalized by the course 
instructor and are then posted in Zambeel by the Office of the Registrar. 
 
21.1. 
Student Evaluation 
Students are formally evaluated by the faculty through appropriate instruments, as specified in the course 
outline. The defined course instruments are used in grading the course. These may typically include but are 
not limited to the following: 
 
• 
Quizzes 
• 
Assignments 
• 
Projects 
• 
Class participation 
• 
Examinations 
 
The instructor informs students about the weightage assigned to each instrument. This is mentioned in the 
course outline, and it is used for evaluating student performance in the course. 
 
21.2. 
Grading Policy 
Course grades are based on cumulative performance in defined instruments.  
 
The final grades are assigned as follows: 
 
Letter Grades and their Numeric Equivalents

Grading at LUMS is based on relative performance. However, for some courses, absolute grading is used. This information is 
mentioned in the course outline. 
A+ and F are absolute grades. The other grades (A to D) may be awarded based on relative performance. 
*P grade will contribute towards the earned credits and will not affect the CGPA. 

36 
 
**W has no numeric equivalence and credit hours for withdrawn courses will not count towards the credit hours taken in the 
semester. 
***I grade is awarded if a student has completed 90% of the directed course work (DCW) in the semester and the remaining 
is to be completed in 6-8 weeks into the next semester (Summer not counted). After the semester absolute grading deadline, 
a list of students with I grade is sent to the respective department coordinators/instructors and students, mentioning the 6 
weeks’ deadline. In case the grade is not received by this deadline, two weeks’ extension deadline is communicated. After this 
buffer, an F is assigned on the system. If not repeated and replaced, F grade will count towards Semester GPA, CGPA and 
SCGPA. 
In the case of “I” grade, once the result of the directed course work (DCW) is announced, the I grade is replaced by attained 
grade. The semester GPA and CGPA are recomputed, and the student academic record is updated accordingly. 
If the Senior Project is to be completed in two semesters, then the final grade for SPROJ A & B (registered in two consecutive 
semesters) is assigned at the end of the second semester. In the interim, there will be no grade assigned to SPROJ A. 
In case a multi term project is not completed within the absolute grading deadline for the former term in which SPROJ B was 
enrolled, then an I grade may be assigned if 90% of the coursework is complete.  
**** T in the transcript grades column, signifies that the respective course credits have been approved and transferred to 
LUMS. 
 
21.3. 
Calculation of Semester GPA 
Semester GPA, CGPA and SCGPA are calculated and are based on all courses’ grades attained at LUMS.  
Accordingly, GPAs made visible on the transcript truly reflect the academic performance of a student.   
 
The GPA in a particular semester, i.e., the Semester Grade Point Average, is calculated using the following 
method: 
• 
The instructor assigns a certain letter grade to a student in a particular course. The numeric 
equivalent of that grade is provided in Table below. 
• 
The grade points for all the courses taken in that particular semester are calculated and added 
together. 
• 
The sum is then divided by the total number of credit hours taken in that semester. The quotient 
is the Semester GPA.

15 = 2.56 
 
While semester GPA is calculated using all credit hours attempted in the semester (15 in the above 
example), it is only the successfully completed credit hours (12 in the above example) that count towards 
the graduation requirements. 
 
Note: Credit hours for withdrawn courses and courses with an F grade neither count towards graduation 
requirements nor towards the successfully completed credit hours for the semester. 
 

37 
 
21.4. 
Calculation of Cumulative GPA (CGPA) 
The calculation of Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) follows the same procedure. In this case the 
calculation is based on all the courses taken since joining the undergraduate programme. 
 
An illustrative example with hypothetical data for CGPA calculation is worked out in Tables below:

Furthermore, at the time of graduation, SCGPA (Specialization CGPA) is also visible on the transcript and is 
calculated on the basis of major cores, major electives and free electives in the area of the major. 
Above mentioned method is applicable even if a student has taken courses beyond the defined credit limit 
requirement of a degree programme.  
 
21.5. 
Grade Review Policy 
There may be instances when a student believes that there is a discrepancy in his/her final grade. A review 
of grade plea is acceptable only in the case of a computational error. 

38 
 
If a student wishes to dispute a grade, he or she needs to contact the course instructor. If the instructor 
does not agree, the student may appeal to the head of the department and in extreme circumstances, to 
the Dean of the School within two weeks after the final grade is visible in his/her Zambeel self-service. 
 
21.6. 
Grade Change Policy 
In the grade review process, if the student’s request is justified and change in grade is approved, then only 
the instructor of the course can file a grade change petition to the Office of the Registrar within the 
deadline, using the Grade Change Petition Form available at the Office of the Registrar portal 
http://portal.lums.edu.pk/RegistrarOffice. Department staff/TAs cannot sign in lieu of the instructor. 
Approval of the head of the department and School Dean is mandatory for the grade change to come into 
effect. 
 
In case the instructor is no longer associated with LUMS, the head of the department is authorized to 
review the grade change request. 
 
21.7. 
Course Pass/Fail Policy 
The purpose of the course Pass/Fail policy is to provide students with the opportunity to take courses of 
interest outside of their major field of study and to learn without concern for the grade having an impact 
on their GPA. This policy encourages learning diversity and provides students, who have not decided upon 
a major, the opportunity to explore different areas of study. 
 
The important points regarding this policy are: 
• 
It is the prerogative of individual instructors as to whether they wish to allow their course to be taken 
as Pass/Fail. The student should only proceed to apply for Pass/Fail for a course if the instructor agrees.  
• 
First year students in their first semester are excluded from this policy. 
• 
A student can choose to designate a course as Pass/Fail till the same date as the Drop Only deadline 
• 
Pass/Fail courses can only count towards the free electives’ requirement.  
• 
Hence Pass/Fail courses cannot be taken from within the major core OR elective courses, (even if such 
courses are in excess of the major requirements), OR count towards the University Distribution 
requirements.  
• 
Students can only convert courses to Pass/Fail which are outside of their major field of study. If 
students choose courses for Pass/Fail conversion which are cross listed with their major field of study, 
such courses cannot be converted to Pass/Fail even if those courses are fulfilling their free electives’ 
requirement.  
• 
In case of a change of major, if the courses previously taken as Pass/Fail fall under the new major core, 
major elective, or In/Out group bin requirements of the new major, the courses must be repeated with 
letter grading scheme.  
• 
Pass/Fail courses do not count towards fulfilment of a minor.  
• 
A course designated as Pass/Fail can be repeated only with Pass/Fail grading scheme. Similarly, a 
course already taken as letter grade cannot be converted into Pass/Fail at the time of repeat/replace.  
• 
Up to 10 credit hours can be taken as Pass/Fail during the entire degree tenure, inclusive of all SWR 
courses, Independent Study, Directed Research Project, Internship (in case of SDSB students) and any 
other course previously graded as Pass/Fail. 
• 
C or higher grade attained in a course which has been designated as Pass/Fail will not be visible on the 
transcript and will not count towards the calculation of Semester GPA, Cumulative GPA and 
Specialization CGPA. Only the attained Pass/Fail grade is visible on the transcript. 

39 
 
• 
In a Pass/Fail designated course, a Pass grade is awarded, if the attained cumulative percentage in the 
course is equivalent to a C or higher grade, as per the grading scale applied to the entire class.  
• 
A Pass grade will have no effect on the CGPA and the credit for the course is earned, whereas a Fail 
grade will negatively count towards the CGPA calculation with no credit given for the course.  
• 
Pass/Fail Courses are not converted to letter grade for the computation of Honours and Awards. 
However, these credits will count towards the credit hour requirement for DHL. 
• 
Summer is an accelerated semester, the courses enrolled during summer semester cannot be 
converted to Pass/Fail.  
 
22. Attendance Policy 
22.1. 
BA (Honours)/BS/BSc (Honours) Programmes 
Students are expected to attend all classes to take full advantage of the learning opportunities. They also 
need to avoid missing surprise quizzes so that the course grade is not negatively affected. 
 
Some instructors require attendance to be mandatory (with a penalty for missing classes) and have 
substantial grade reduction associated with absences, as given in the respective course outline for each 
course. 
 
22.2. 
B.A.-LLB (Honours) Programme (LL. B Years I, II, and III) 
In the B.A.-LLB (Honours) programme, attendance is mandatory.  Missing four or more cases can result in 
the penalty of a reduction of one letter grade from a student’s eventual overall letter grade. Furthermore, 
anyone who is ten minutes late for a class is marked absent, unless s/he has a legitimate excuse 
communicated through prior notification to the teacher or in exceptional cases, formally communicated 
after class to the instructor or TA. 
 
23. Examinations 
The Office of the Registrar allocates auditoriums for conduction of examinations. As a norm, the mid-term 
and final examinations follow the regular class meeting pattern. Students are strongly advised to take 
courses keeping this in mind. As a norm, large classes and courses requiring combined examinations are 
planned on the weekends or the late evening time slot during weekdays. Students are required to take 
examinations as scheduled.  For missed examinations, refer to Policy No. 24 on Make-up Policy for Graded 
Instruments. 
 
The following additional detail relates to the conducting of examinations at LUMS: 
• 
During an examination, a student may not leave the auditorium without the permission of the 
invigilator. If allowed, only one person at a time is allowed to go out of the room. 
• 
No question papers and answer books are to be taken out of the examination room during the 
examination. 
• 
All students are required to bring their LUMS student smart card for the examination. The invigilator 
and/or instructor reserves the right to check the ID of the students. 
• 
Mobile phones and other communication devices are not allowed in the examination venue. 
• 
The duration of an examination is determined by the instructor and no extension in the time is given 
unless allowed by him/her. 
• 
Students are not allowed to enter the examination room if they are late by more than 30 minutes. No 
extra time is granted. 
• 
Students may not leave the auditorium till 45 minutes of the examination time has elapsed. 

40 
 
• 
In case of natural/medical emergencies, students may be allowed to leave the examination room 
accompanied by an invigilator. 
 
24. Make-up Policy for Graded Instruments   
The purview of this policy includes all instruments/sub-instruments of a course impacted by a short-term, 
serious emergency or circumstances beyond a student's control; academic accommodations for disabilities 
are the purview of the Office of Accessibility & Inclusion (OAI).  
24.1  Rationale and overview  
As an institute of higher learning, LUMS considers academics as the university’s central activity and class 
attendance / assessments are an integral part of this learning process. Further, giving different time periods 
or opportunities to different students is impossible for instructors and also unfair to those students who 
receive less time or fewer opportunities for assessments. For these reasons, absence from examinations 
or missing graded instruments is strongly discouraged and only permissible in extreme situations beyond 
the student’s control. This allowance is to balance the integrity/equity of the assessment system while 
providing flexibility in rare and exceptional emergencies: i) serious medical conditions (that persist despite 
adequate treatment and whose severity significantly impacts studies); ii) death in the immediate family; 
iii) certain pre-approved extracurricular activities (where the student is officially representing LUMS at a 
prestigious forum); iv) visa interviews (for higher studies/immigration), job interviews for graduating 
seniors, and other emergencies (see below for additional details on each situation).   
24.2  Process of petitioning and associated timelines  
Petition for any known-in-advance event/activity (e.g. sports tournament, extra-curricular commitments, 
weddings, and any other known-in-advance activity) must be submitted to SSS as soon as the event/activity 
date is known and no later than one week prior to the instrument date/deadline (note: this deadline 
includes all required documents, so students should plan well in advance of this deadline). This is required 
out of courtesy to course instructors, so they can also plan accordingly in advance. Please note that 
petitions after the instrument deadline will only be entertained for unanticipated emergencies that could 
not have been planned for in advance. 
To petition for any unforeseen emergencies, the student or someone on their behalf must submit the 
petition form along with all required documentation as soon as possible; this is necessary so that course 
instructors can be informed of the potential accommodation needed in a timely fashion. This submission 
should ideally happen prior to the instrument’s deadline but no later than three days after missing the 
graded instrument for which relief is being sought. 
Petition-submission is not considered complete until all required documentation has also been submitted. 
This means a petition for instruments whose dates/ deadlines fall outside the timeline as mentioned in the 
above situations will not be processed.  Therefore, it is important for students to submit the petition form 
and all necessary documents as soon as possible (or request someone to do so on their behalf), rather than 
waiting for the resolution of the emergency impacting their studies). 
When to request course Instructor or Program and when to request SSS (with possible outcomes in 
each scenario).  
The request must be submitted to the  Instructor or Program(i.e. the Program Coordination 
Office/Deans’ Office/Advising unit) in cases where the missed instruments total 10% or less of the course 
grade; OR to the Office of Student Support Services at petitions@lums.edu.pk (in cases where the missed 
instruments total more than 10% of the course grade). This system balances two important elements of 

41 
 
education at LUMS: the principle of instructor and program autonomy over their courses/ grading (when 
the impact on the course grade is up to 10%) and the principle of equitable treatment of students across 
campus in all courses/programs (when the impact on the course grade exceeds 10%).  
When relief is being sought for a specific situation and the instruments collectively comprise 10% or 
less of the course grade (in a single course), the Instructor or Program (i.e. the Program Coordination 
Office/Deans’ Office/Advising Unit) shall have the prerogative to ascertain the circumstances and 
determine the path forward for the student in that course. The respective roles of the program vs the 
course instructor is the prerogative of the school; per school policies, the program may play a supportive 
role (i.e. guiding the instructor on how to handle the situation but leaving the determination to the 
instructor’s discretion) or the program may play a determinative role (i.e. deciding the outcome and 
informing the course instructor/student). In either case, Student Support Services will not process such 
petitions and therefore students should contact the course Instructor or Program directly as soon as 
possible, ideally prior to the instrument’s deadline (for any known-in-advance activity) and no later than 3 
days (for unanticipated emergencies) after the deadline for the instrument for which relief is being sought. 
In these cases, the instructor or Program should decide per school policies and communicate with the 
student within a week of receiving the request. Instructors/Program have the full range of options available 
to them, based on their assessment of the circumstances and their course policies:  
i) Allowing a retake of the missed instrument. (Note: the retake can include a different version of the missed 
instrument – so that the student does not benefit from speaking with those who have already attempted 
the instrument – or an alternate form of assessment deemed appropriate by the instructor for the learning 
being assessed).  
ii) Applying the course’s pre-existing N-X policy OR assigning an average or percentile received by the 
student in other sub-instruments till the end of the course (for instruments with multiple sub-instruments, 
e.g. CP, quizzes, etc.).  
iii) Assigning an average grade or percentile received by the student in other instruments till the end of the 
course (for instruments that do not have any ‘sub-instruments’ e.g. mid-terms or final exams); 
iv) Denying the request and assigning a zero score for that instrument.  
Note: In no circumstances can the student be assigned the ‘class average’ or a grade based on the 
performance of other students in the course.  Instructors are encouraged to consult their Program 
Coordination office/Dean’s office/School’s advising unit or HoD about: a) school-level policies and 
guidelines for handling student requests that constitute 10% or less of the course grade; or b) how best to 
accommodate a student whose petition has been approved by OSA. 
When relief is being sought for a specific situation and the impacted instruments collectively 
comprise more than 10% of the course grade (in a single course) a request for a make-up must be 
made by the student or someone on his/her behalf, on the Make-up Instrument Petition Form which is to 
be submitted to the Office of Student Support Services (SSS) at petitions@lums.edu.pk along with the other 
required documents.  This petition-submission must adhere to the deadlines mentioned in the section 
above titled “Process of petitioning and associated timelines” (i.e. for any known-in-advance activity, the 
submission must occur as soon as the date is known and no later than a week prior to the instrument 
deadline – and for unforeseen emergencies, the petition must be submitted as soon as possible and no 
later than 3 days of the instrument date/deadline).  
The petition is processed by the SSS after due diligence and the student is notified of the decision, at most 
within 48-72 working hours after all required documentation has been submitted. Submitting a petition 
does not guarantee its approval. Depending on the circumstances and documentation, the petition could 

42 
 
be denied, in which case a zero score will be assigned to that instrument. If the petition is approved, there 
is no grade reduction on the approved make-up instrument. (Note: even if a petition is approved, the 
specific dates or instruments approved will be based on the verifiable circumstances established through 
appropriate documentation. This could be different from the dates/instruments requested by the student 
and could exclude certain dates/instruments for which: i) the documentation is incomplete or does not 
conclusively establish the circumstances; or ii) the established circumstances do not meet the criteria laid 
out in this policy).  
Once approved, the instructor or Program will be notified, and they will have the discretion to select the 
most appropriate option for proceeding:  
i. 
Allowing a retake of the missed instrument. (Note: The re-take can include a different version of 
the missed instrument – so that the student does not benefit from speaking with those who have 
already attempted the instrument – or it can be an alternate form of assessment deemed 
appropriate by the instructor for the learning being assessed. However, a re-take is not required if 
there is no pathway to passing the course even if the missed instrument is retaken) 
ii. 
ii) Applying the course’s pre-existing N-X policy OR assigning an average or percentile received by 
the student in other sub-instruments till the end of the course (for instruments with multiple sub-
instruments, e.g. CP, quizzes, etc.) 
iii. 
Assigning an average grade or percentile received by the student in other instruments till the end 
of the course (for instruments that do not have any ‘sub-instruments’ e.g. mid-terms or final 
exams).  
Note: In order to receive a grade for a course, students must have graded instruments that cumulatively 
account for at least 70% of the course grade. Therefore, if the missed instrument/s account for 30% or 
more of the course grade, then this option of extrapolating ‘average in other instruments to the missed 
instrument’ – is not available and a retake is required (see the guidance for retakes given in option #i 
earlier). Further, in no circumstances can the student be assigned the class average, or a grade based on 
the performance of other students in the course.  
 
24.3  Other elements of the policy:  
• 
For missed final examinations: private arrangements for a make-up of the final examination between 
a student and an instructor are not allowed. The student is required to submit a petition to Student 
Support Services, so that the circumstances for missing the final exam can be ascertained through 
appropriate documentation. If the make-up exam option is granted, the make-up exam must be 
conducted by the instructor within two weeks of the original exam date in case of a regular semester, 
and within a week in case of a final graduating semester.  
• 
Students who have already attempted an instrument cannot petition for a makeup for the same 
instrument (this includes situations when the student has entered the examination hall). Students who 
miss a scheduled make-up exam will not be given a second chance.   
• 
In situations where the petitioned instruments account for 50% or more of the course grade, the 
appropriate accommodation may be to withdraw from the course and re-take the course when the 
student is better able to meet the course’s academic requirements.   
• 
If – for any reason or circumstance – a student requests one or more petitions at any time during the 
semester that cumulatively add up to more than 21 days (including weekends) during spring/fall, or 
more than 7 days (including weekends) during summer, this constitutes the loss of a significant portion 
of the time allocated for teaching/learning during the semester. In such cases, SSS will forward the 
case to the Dean OSA for consideration for an involuntary semester withdrawal so that the student 

43 
 
can resume studies in a future semester when their circumstances allow them to engage with their 
studies and learning.   
• 
Certain course outlines may limit the number of absences allowed. In cases where a student’s petition 
is approved and it clashes with the course’s policy on the number of absences allowed, SSS will attempt 
to work with the instructor; if the instructor feels that the course’s learning objectives are impossible 
to achieve given the absences approved in the petition, SSS will explore the possibility of a course 
withdrawal for the student.  
• 
In the last three weeks of the semester, if a student petitions for final exams/projects/papers etc. in 
three or more courses, or requests for withdrawal from two or more courses, this means that the 
gravity of medical or other circumstances is posing a major hurdle in completing academic 
requirements. In this context, while relief for semester-completion may be warranted, at the same 
time, continuing immediately in the subsequent semester may not be appropriate because of the 
seriousness of medical or other circumstances that are impacting studies. Therefore, if requests for 
course-withdrawals from two or more courses or petitions for final exams/ projects/ papers etc. in 
three or more courses in the last three weeks of the semester are approved, SSS will make a 
determination within three weeks of the petition about whether an involuntary withdrawal in the 
subsequent fall or spring semester is warranted, to allow time for handling the circumstances and their 
lowering future impact on studies. (Note: if an involuntary withdrawal is decided, appropriate 
documentation will be required prior to resumption of studies in the subsequent fall or spring 
semester. Furthermore, enrollment in summer will not be possible until the student is cleared to 
resume studies).  
• 
Any misrepresentation in the petition or documentation constitutes fraud as well as cheating (i.e. an 
attempt to secure course credit through unfair means) and therefore may result in a referral to the 
Disciplinary Committee (DC). 
  
24.4  Circumstances covered by the policy  
The make-up instrument policy is applicable to the following situations. (As mentioned above, Student 
Support Services will only be involved for petitions when more than 10% of the course-grade is impacted).  
24.4.1. Medical Cases  
Relief is only granted for medical circumstances that are verified by LUMS healthcare professionals as 
having symptoms of such severity as to seriously hinder meeting academic commitments. In such 
circumstances, the student must consult with the LUMS Medical Center (LMC) or on-campus Counseling 
and Psychological Services (CAPS).   
While documentation from on-campus healthcare facilities (LUMS Medical Center and CAPS) is highly 
preferred, in cases where the student is out of station or away from the campus, the student should submit 
complete and official medical documentation related to the illness and medical treatment, i.e., original 
copies of the clinical reports, doctor’s evaluation, hospitalization details, medication receipts, contact 
information of  treating physician, etc. to the Office of Student Support Services, within three days of the 
missed instrument.   
In such circumstances, Student Support Services will evaluate the medical documentation in consultation 
with LMC/CAPS and may require additional documentation and/or direct communication with the treating 
physician or clinician, before deciding about the petition.  
In all cases, clinical evaluations and written assessments from the treating physician or counselor must be 
obtained while the student is unwell. Note: petitions can only be processed when the medical and clinical 

44 
 
evaluation was conducted at a time that can clearly establish medical impairment at the time of the missed 
instrument; therefore, retroactive clinical evaluations about past illnesses cannot be processed. SSS may 
further consult with the Medical Center or CAPS to determine whether the severity of symptoms warrants 
relief and may require students to submit additional documentation.  
Students are expected to look after their well-being responsibly. Inadequate engagement with healthcare 
and treatment means that the resulting impact is a consequence of choice (i.e., the choice of not engaging 
with healthcare/treatment). Such cases are therefore not covered by this policy, which is for emergencies 
beyond the student’s control.   
24.4.2. Death or illness in the Immediate Family  
In the unfortunate event of a death in the immediate family (strictly limited to parents, siblings, spouse, 
children or grandparents only), students should file a makeup exam petition to SSS within a week of the 
demise.   
The Office of Student Support Services may need to verify the documentation in due course and will inform 
the student regarding the decision. Petitions will not be entertained for demise of any individuals or 
relatives other than specified above in the policy.  
In cases of illness in the immediate family, relief is only granted for cases where: a) the unwell relative is 
the student’s sibling, parent, or child; b) there is documented overnight admission to the hospital for a 
severe illness; and c) other caregivers are not available to enable the student to meet their academic 
commitments.  
24.4.3. Extra-Curricular Activities  
If a student is proceeding to participate in an event which is considered prestigious by the University, the 
patrons of the relevant societies/clubs/sports teams should try to negotiate a date for the event with the 
event organizers that does not conflict with the midterm/final exam schedule or other academic 
commitments. If the negotiations fail, the patron should inform the SSS per the deadline mentioned in the 
section above titled “Process of petitioning and associated timelines” (i.e. for any known-in-advance 
activity, the submission must occur as soon as the date is known and no later than a week prior to the 
instrument deadline. Note: students can be allowed to participate in activities like conferences if endorsed 
by their faculty adviser or their School’s advising Unit/Dean’s office (as being important enough for their 
academic learning to warrant a petition for missed course instruments).  
In the case of an international event, one extra day before and after the event to account for travel logistics 
can be petitioned for. Extra days spent on private extensions of the trip will not be permissible.  
In case of sports events, students participating in the following may file a petition:  
- 
HEC inter-varsity events,  
- 
games organized on national/regional or international scale. 
All sports events other than the ones prescribed in this policy will not be processed.  
24.4.4. Visa/Employment Cases  
Graduating seniors who have a job interview, and students from any class who have applied for a study 
visa or immigration visa and have been called for an interview on the date of an instrument are allowed a 
makeup instrument without grade reduction. The deadline will be determined per the “Process of 
petitioning and associated timelines” section above (i.e. if the interview date was known in advance, then 
the petition should be made as soon as the date is known and no later than a week prior to the instrument; 
if the interview date was communicated at the last minute, then the petition must occur as soon as the 

45 
 
student knows and no later than three days after the instrument date/deadline). Petitions for interviews 
or visas other than the ones indicated in this policy will not be granted (e.g., internship interviews for non-
graduating students, or travel/business visa cases or spousal visas/interviews, umrah and leisure trips etc.)  
24.4.5. Other circumstances  
Petitions for wedding/marriage events are only allowed for marriage of siblings or self, and only for the 
main events of nikkah/mehndi, barat and walima. As mentioned above in “Process of petitioning and 
associated timelines” all documentation must be provided as soon as the event dates are set and no later 
than one week before the instrument date/deadline. For weddings in Lahore, petitions will only be granted 
for instruments clashing with the specific event date and time. For wedding locations out of the city, 
petitions may be granted from the first main event to the last main event. For wedding locations abroad, 
one day of travel time can be granted before and after the main events.  
For other emergencies, the student will apply to the SSS either prior to or within three days of the 
date/deadline for the instrument for which relief is being requested, with the provision of adequate 
documentation that establishes the emergency. Petitions will not be entertained for circumstances that 
can be catered for through better planning (e.g., traffic delays, power outages, equipment malfunctions, 
etc.)  
25. Student Code of Conduct 
 
25.1 Introduction 
 
25.1.1 Preamble 
The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) is a unique residential campus and a site of 
learning, discovery, transformation, advancing knowledge and intellectual growth for its students. The 
University has accomplished this by maintaining academic freedom, the free flow of ideas, open 
dialogue, accessibility, and through maintaining the integrity of the University’s processes. This is made 
possible by a highly diverse community that comprises students, staff, and faculty. In order to uphold 
the integrity of the institution LUMS expects its students to understand and adopt the guiding principles 
that undergird this institution. The values, principles and general practices are laid out in the Student 
Code of Conduct. 
The Student Code of Conduct is based on the premise that LUMS is a shared community comprising 
students, staff and faculty, many of whom also live on campus. Each community member’s behaviour 
impacts both their own learning as well as the ability of others to access or participate in this university’s 
learning experiences. Therefore, LUMS’ commitment to learning automatically entails upholding 
behaviours that maximize the entire community’s learning. This also requires the institution to intervene 
when any individual’s behaviour negatively impacts the person’s own or other people’s ability to access 
or participate in the LUMS experience.  
This Code also assumes that LUMS is not just an educational institution but also a civic one. Its investment 
in education is purposeful: to have a positive impact on society. LUMS accomplishes this by producing 
graduates who can play a positive role in all the communities they are a part of. In short, the goal of 
producing good citizens is entailed by LUMS’ own citizenship: the institution’s desire to positively impact 
the society in which it is embedded. The LUMS’ Code of Conduct is essential to this institutional mission 
of producing graduates who can make a positive contribution to society. LUMS cultivates this civic 
awareness by requiring all its affiliates to live and practice it during and beyond their time at LUMS. 

46 
 
Membership in the LUMS community is a privilege, not a right. This privilege is retained by upholding 
the values of this community within and outside of the institution.  
A shared community that upholds civic values necessarily places the utmost importance on pluralism. 
LUMS is a diverse, plural community that celebrates gender inclusion, various ethnic, racial, religious and 
socioeconomic backgrounds as well as affiliations–faculty, students, and staff. This commitment to 
pluralism means that we learn to cohabit in shared spaces– the LUMS campus and by extension the cities 
and country that we live in, through responsible behaviour and civic sensitivity.  
As an institution aiming for excellence, LUMS aspires for all affiliates to embody the ideals and practices 
highlighted above to the highest extent possible. The goal is for all affiliates to uphold behaviours that 
promote – in the best possible way – the sustenance of a shared space where everyone can flourish. 
However, when anyone’s behaviour begins to negatively impact their own or others’ ability to participate 
effectively in this community, then LUMS is committed to intervening to rectify the situation for the sake 
of maintaining an appropriate learning and living environment. For transparency, it is necessary to clarify 
behaviours that will trigger an institutional response. While it is necessary to enumerate this list of 
sanctionable behaviours, it is also important to clarify avoiding sanctions is only minimally acceptable 
behaviour, not excellent behaviour. In other words, the space allocated to sanctionable behaviours here 
is a function of transparency not priority. LUMS requires all members to adhere to minimally acceptable 
behaviours but LUMS aspires for all members to embody excellent behaviours. 
 
25.1.2 Purpose 
Students are integral members of the LUMS community, and they are entitled to numerous privileges 
and rights. However, they also bear the responsibility to conduct themselves in an honorable, ethical, 
and appropriate manner, and to adhere to the rules and regulations of LUMS. The Student Code of 
Conduct describes the standard of behaviour expected from every LUMS student and specifies actions 
that will be considered violations of the conduct expected from a LUMS student. 
 
25.1.3 Applicability and Jurisdiction 
This Code of Conduct is applicable to all LUMS’ students, alumni, and student organizations at LUMS. 
• On-campus jurisdiction: The disciplinary jurisdiction of this Code of Conduct extends to any misconduct 
by a student, alumnus or student organization that occurs on LUMS campus, or in a LUMS student‐housing 
facility that may be situated off-campus. 
 
• Off-campus jurisdiction:  The interaction of LUMS community with the people, institutions, 
professional societies and organizations outside of LUMS, is an important aspect of LUMS mission and 
activities. The members of the LUMS community are expected to behave ethically, honorably, 
professionally and in keeping with LUMS core values and quality standards at all times. Therefore, the 
disciplinary jurisdiction of this Code of Conduct also extends to misconduct that occurs off-‐campus. 
Students should be particularly mindful of behaviour when representing LUMS off-campus. However, 
if an egregious violation of the code is brought to the attention of the University at any occasion 
relating to behaviour off-campus the University reserves the right to penalization. This is particularly 
important whilst representing LUMS but also applies otherwise.  
 
In exceptional circumstances where the university determines, based on information of off‐campus 
behaviour, that a student or alumnus may pose a risk to the campus community, the university may 

47 
 
restrict or suspend the individual’s campus access privileges and may impose disciplinary sanctions, 
even for off-campus behaviour when not representing LUMS. 
 
Disciplinary proceedings at LUMS may be instituted for an act of misconduct even if there is civil or 
criminal litigation pending for that action in a court of law. Disciplinary sanctions may be imposed prior 
to, during, or after the litigation has run its course. 
 
25.1.4 Responsibility to Understand the Code of Conduct 
It is mandatory for every student, alumnus, and student organization to understand and adhere to this 
Code of Conduct. Ignorance of the Code of Conduct will not be accepted as a valid defense during 
disciplinary proceedings. Queries seeking clarifications regarding this Code of Conduct may be addressed 
to: osa@lums.edu.pk.  
 
25.2  General Expectations of Conduct 
One of the aims of the programs at LUMS is the development of personal and professional ethics among 
students. Students are expected to conduct themselves honourably in all aspects of their life at LUMS. 
They are expected to uphold all LUMS’ values listed in the previous section. 
The university expects all LUMS students to take responsibility for their actions. Their behaviour should 
reflect a respect of law, a consideration of the rights of others, the Student Code of Conduct in academic 
and non-‐ academic matters, and shared standards of considerate and ethical behaviour.  
Disciplinary sanctions may be imposed in case of violations of this Code of Conduct. Examples of 
disciplinary sanctions include, but are not limited to, fines, community service hours, or academic 
penalties, such as probation, separation or expulsion from the university. A student expelled for 
disciplinary reasons will not be considered for readmission. 
 
25.2.1 Maintaining Decorum 
All members of the LUMS community share the responsibility of maintaining an atmosphere of mutual 
respect and are expected to show good and tact in all matters. Students are expected to maintain proper 
decorum and etiquette and demonstrate the core values of pluralism and respect while interacting with 
their peers, faculty members, guest speakers and the staff at LUMS. 
Students are expected to be respectful towards faculty and staff of all ranks; they should exhibit a 
dignified demeanor and respect the rights, differences, and dignity of all members of the LUMS 
community. 
 
25.2.2 Classroom Behaviour 
Students should not be late for classes and should not leave the classroom when the class is in session 
except under special circumstances, with the permission of the instructor. They should not exchange 
notes, cross talk, or use their mobile phones during class. 
 
25.2.3 Obligation to prove identity 
Students must possess their Student ID smart cards at all times while on campus and present them upon 
entry. They are obliged to show their ID if asked by faculty and/or staff of all ranks. Failure to do so will 
result in disciplinary action.  
 

48 
 
25.2.4 General Behaviour in Public Spaces  
Students must remember that the LUMS campus is a shared space, and they must govern their behaviour 
accordingly. Inappropriate behaviour includes but is not limited to: public indecency (individual, couple, 
or group), acts of intimacy that are overtly sexual in nature, unprompted or random usage of obscene 
language, and indecent behaviour overt or covert towards an individual.  Inappropriate behaviour can 
lead to disciplinary action or be referred to the student’s parents. 
 
25.2.5 Appropriate Dress 
The LUMS community is expected to dress in a fashion that reflects high standards of professional 
decorum. The dress should be in congruence with broad cultural sensibilities and should reflect a 
consideration of the diverse and mixed community present here at LUMS.  There is no prescribed uniform 
in the university. All members of the LUMS community must exhibit a propriety in their dress that 
corresponds to a professional environment. Clothing that carries indecent or vulgar comments or implies 
obscenities, as well as attire that is revealing is deemed unacceptable.  
While on campus, students are expected to be neatly and appropriately dressed at all times, and 
especially for interviews, class presentations, seminars by guest speakers, and other academic events. 
 
25.2.6 Keeping the Campus Clean 
All members of LUMS community have a shared responsibility to keep the campus clean. This means no 
littering on campus, inside or outside classrooms. Trash cans are placed on campus at several locations. All 
members are urged to use these trashcans and refrain from littering on campus. 
 
25.2.7 Eating and Drinking 
Eating and drinking is, in general, not allowed in academic buildings and the Library, except in areas 
designated for this purpose. Food and drinks, with the exception of water, are not allowed in classrooms, 
discussion rooms, laboratories and the library. 
 
25.2.8 Smoking  
Smoking is prohibited in all facilities and areas of LUMS, except for the designated Smoking Zones located 
throughout the campus. Smoking is not permitted outside these zones. Furthermore, this definition 
extends to university owned or leased vehicles outside LUMS. 
 
Cigarette waste should be disposed of properly in a safe manner in designated outdoor ashtrays. Fire 
hazard, campus safety and cleanliness should be considered in disposing of cigarettes and ash. Smokers 
will be held responsible for any violations. Non- compliance of the smoking policy will result in fines and 
possible disciplinary action. Visitors refusing to comply with the policy shall be asked to leave the 
campus. For detailed guidelines, please access the Smoking, Drugs and Alcohol Abuse Policy present on 
the LUMS website. 
Faculty and staff are authorized to approach and collect the smart cards of anyone found littering or 
smoking outside designated areas on campus. Cards are to be sent to the security desk at the main 
gate where the offenders may reclaim them after paying a Rs. 5000 fine. 
 
25.2.9 Drugs and Alcohol 
Drugs and alcohol, as defined by the Acts and Ordinances, are not permitted anywhere on campus, at 
any time, without exception. 
 

49 
 
Non- compliance of the drug policy will result in possible disciplinary action. Visitors refusing to comply 
with the policy shall be asked to leave the campus. For detailed guidelines, please access the Smoking, 
Drugs and Alcohol Abuse Policy present on the LUMS website. 
 
25.2.10 Visiting Guests 
It is the responsibility of the members to ensure that their guests adhere to the security rules, 
regulations, and behavioural norms of the University.  
Guests must not possess or consume any type of contraband within LUMS. If a violation occurs, the host 
will be held responsible for their actions. Please refer to the updated LUMS Visitors' Policy. 
 
25.2.11 Distribution of Written Materials and Posting of Notices 
Free inquiry, free expression and civility within the academic community are indispensable to the 
University's objectives. Inclusion of the name, telephone number or e‐mail address of the University 
sponsoring organization or individual member of the University community on material resembling 
petitions, posters, or leaflets distributed on campus is required. Such notices can only be posted on 
noticeboards. Complaints against offensive notices can be lodged with the Office of Student Affairs at 
osa@lums.edu.pk. 
 
25.3  Misconduct 
The following actions will be considered misconduct whether they occur on campus, off-campus and/in 
an online space and will be treated as a violation of the Student Code of Conduct at LUMS. 
 
In addition to violations of the general expectations of conduct, there are specific categories of 
misbehaviour that may result in penalties and further violations. The list below is not exhaustive. The 
University reserves the right to penalize behaviour that does not align with the Student Code of Conduct 
 
In the case where the incident of misconduct does not elicit a sanction/penalty based on University’s 
code the University reserves the right to decide based on its core values, principles and good judgement. 
 
25.3.1 Discrimination 
a. Expressions of racial, religious, ethnic, socio-economic status or gender bias, or discrimination based 
on these factors, directed at individuals or groups. 
b. Unequal treatment that entails demeaning another person for reasons including but not limited to 
race, gender, creed, or origin. 
c. Violation of merit for such reasons. 
 
25.3.2  Aggressive Behaviour and Interpersonal Misconduct 
LUMS has zero‐tolerance for any form of aggressive behaviour such as harassment, stalking, or ragging 
activities. Misconduct of this type includes, but is not limited to: 
 
a. Stalking, which refers to a pattern of unwanted and persistent pursuit and intrusion into the life of 
another person, such as following them around, appearing uninvited at their place of residence, 
employment, or education, as well as making other attempts to contact the target, who clearly does not 
desire it. Stalking is a pattern of behaviour is such that it is repetitive, and it causes stress in the victim, 
who experiences it as a threat and may therefore realistically fear for their physical safety. 

50 
 
 
b. Harassment is behaviour the purpose of which is to humiliate, discomfit, or otherwise psychologically 
torment or provoke the target, whether through words, gestures, or actions. Although usually stopping 
short of actual physical aggression, harassment is an act of hostility that has a disruptive effect on the 
victim’s ability to function at work or school. Sexual harassment, which is any unwelcome sexual 
advance, request for sexual favors or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a 
sexual nature, or sexually demeaning attitudes, causing interference with work performance or creating 
an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for 
refusal to comply to such a request or is made a condition for employment. Sexual harassment may 
involve the behaviour of a person of either sex against a person of the opposite or same sex. 
The Disciplinary Committee does not deal with sexual harassment cases. Rather, they are referred to 
Standing Inquiry Committee on Sexual Harassment. [Refer to LUMS Policy on Sexual Harassment 
available on LUMS Portal.] 
 
c.  Hazing or Ragging, which constitutes initiation rituals that involve abuse and that humiliate and 
violate the dignity of a new member. Any new member initiation process should be conducted in a 
manner that respects the dignity of new members and protects their mental and physical well-being. 
The intent of any person engaging in hazing activity or the consent or cooperation of any person who is 
a victim of hazing will not constitute a defense to an allegation of misconduct for hazing. 
 
d.  Physical assault includes not just beating, punching, kicking but any aggressive physical contact such 
as pushing and shoving. In almost all circumstances being provoked will not count as a mitigating factor 
in disciplinary proceedings. Provocations to violence can be physical or non-physical and may include 
abusive language or gestures. Provocation is when a person is considered to have committed a violation 
of the code of conduct because of a preceding set of events that might cause a reasonable individual to 
lose self-control. *   Intimidation refers to menacing behaviour or threats of harm to self, to others or to 
persons related to them, often as a means of coercing the target to acquiesce to the perpetrator’s 
demands. 
 
e.  Photographing others without consent in places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy is 
not allowed. 
 
f. The sharing of images depicting nudity is strongly discouraged, as it can infringe upon individuals' 
privacy, promote unethical behaviours, and create an uncomfortable or unsafe environment. Any such 
activity can be considered a violation of the code of conduct and may solicit a disciplinary 
proceeding. Respecting the boundaries and dignity of others is essential in fostering a culture of 
inclusivity and ensuring a positive community experience. 
 
g.  Any other act that endangers human life or threatens serious physical or psychological injury. 
 
25.3.3 Damage to Property 
a. Theft of, conversion of, misappropriation of, or damage to or destruction of any property of the 
University or property of others while on University premises or at official University functions. 
b. Attempt to set fire on campus, whether successful or unsuccessful, except in places designated for this 
purpose, such as lab burners, cooking stoves, or fireplaces. 
 

51 
 
25.3.4 Unauthorized Possession of Weapons 
The unauthorized possession, storage, use or threat of use on campus of firearms, ammunition, 
explosives, fireworks, firecrackers, or other weapons.

other intoxicating substances is strictly prohibited anywhere on campus. 
b. Offering to sell or obtain these substances. 
 
If a student is part of a group in which intoxicating substances are being consumed, it is in the student’s 
best interest to leave the group to avoid suspicion of involvement or complicity. 
 
25.3.6  Dishonesty, Forgery and Misrepresentation 
Some examples of violations of this category are:

h. Public use of abusive language or curse words. 
i. Discourteous, rude behaviour with faculty or staff of the University. 
 
25.3.9 
Disturbance

of their activities on their fellow members. 
 

52 
 
In public places like the Library, academic buildings, auditoriums, laboratories, and the Pepsi Dining 
Centre, disruptive behaviour is considered irresponsible. Members should refrain from being noisy in the

54 
 
Academic dishonesty is any type of cheating or use of unfair means in the academic context. Academic 
dishonesty includes, but is not limited to: 
 
a. Plagiarism: Plagiarism is representing someone else’s work as your own. Copying someone else’s 
work, without appropriate citation, will constitute plagiarism. At LUMS, training to understand 
plagiarism is provided in introductory courses. Please see the sections below for an 
understanding of plagiarism. 
b. Cheating and Unfair Means: Unfair means include discussions and exchange of all such class 
notes and written material between the current classes and former students that may subvert 
the learning process. Exchanging or passing information to other students over the network 
during lab exams is also considered cheating. 
c. Fabrication: Fabrication of results, data, or any other information or citation, or falsification of 
such information. 
d. Sabotage: An act that prevents others from accessing academic resources that are needed to 
complete their work. 
e. Services: Paying, or obtaining for free, services from someone to complete academic work that 
was required to be completed by oneself. Receiving payment or providing services to complete

an excuse such as illness, death in family or accident. 
h. Aiding and Abetting in Academic Dishonesty: Knowingly aiding in plagiarism or any other form 
of academic dishonesty, for example, by providing solutions of assignment to another student. 
i. Other: Failure to comply with any standards of academic honesty imposed by a faculty member 
or a department. 
 
25.4.1 
What is plagiarism? 
“Plagiarism is the use, without acknowledgement, of the intellectual work of other people, and the act 
of representing the ideas or discoveries of another as one’s own in written work submitted for 
assessment. To copy sentences, phrases or even striking expressions without acknowledgement of the 
source (either by inadequate citation or failure to indicate verbatim quotations) is plagiarism; to 
paraphrase without acknowledgement is likewise plagiarism. Where such copying or paraphrasing has 
occurred, the mere mention of the source in the bibliography shall not be deemed sufficient 
acknowledgement; each such instance must be referred specifically to its source. Verbatim quotations 
must be in inverted commas, or indented, and directly acknowledged.” (University of Sussex 
Examinations and Assessments Handbook 2012/13) 
 
25.4.2 
What is a source? 
Sources are published (print or electronic) primary and secondary material as well as information and 
opinions gained directly from other people. 
 
25.4.3 
Types of plagiarism 
 
Plagiarism falls under two broad categories: 
a. Copying an entire document, or part of a document as your entire paper; 

55 
 
b. Mosaic plagiarism i.e. mixing the words and ideas of a source with your own, or mixing the words and 
ideas of two or more sources without acknowledgement. 
 
Plagiarism usually takes one of these forms: 
a. Incited idea: passing off someone else’s idea as your own. 
b. Incited information or data from a source: not acknowledging the source of any fact, figure, event, 
statistical data, or information provided. 
c. Verbatim phrase or passage that is not quoted: any direct quotation that is not in quotation marks or 
indented and not referenced at the end of the quotation. 
d. Misrepresenting evidence: information from a source that has been changed or taken out of context 
to suit your paper/argument. 
e. Dual submission: submitting the same paper or parts of a paper to more than one course/instructor. 
f. 
Abetting plagiarism: knowingly helping another student to plagiarize by letting him/her copy your 
paper, selling a paper to a student, or by writing all or part of a paper for another student. 
g. Commercial tutoring services: making use of the services of a tutoring school or term paper company 
to write papers. 
 
25.4.4 
Tips to avoid Plagiarism: 
a. Avoid leaving work on your assignment until the last day. It is likely to create a panic situation in which 
one may not make the best decisions. 
b. Avoid relying mainly on a single source for information or opinion. It is likely to result in excessive 
reliance on the thought process of that source. 
c. Avoid borrowing another student’s assignment or notes. 
d. Avoid preparing your solution from borrowed notes. 
e. Do not write your solution with another student, or directly from notes taken when discussing the 
assignment with another student. Even if discussion was allowed, it is better to leave your notes of 
discussion aside and write up the solution entirely on your own. 
f. Always back-‐up your work and make a hard copy wherever it is appropriate to avoid problems created 
by computer failure. 
g. Always keep your notes and drafts until a paper has been returned. 
h. If you feel confused or panicked about time, or if you are having problems that do not let you 
concentrate, let your instructor or teaching assistant know before the submission deadline. 
i. Note-‐taking: When taking notes from a source, always begin by writing down the full bibliographic 
information (author, title, date of publication, publisher, place of publication, page numbers). Always 
distinguish between the author’s own words and your own points. Do not take notes by carelessly 
copying and changing a few words. Take notes in a separate word document. Do not mention sources 
in your bibliography that have not been mentioned in your paper. 
 
25.5  University Disciplinary Procedures 
 
25.5.1 
The Committees on Discipline 
There are two types of Disciplinary Committees charged with investigating violations of the code of 
conduct: one for academic offenses and the other for non-academic offenses. There is one Disciplinary 
Appeals Committee. All these Committees comprise of faculty members and administrators. The two 
Committees are responsible for the administration of the stated rules and regulations governing general 
conduct, for assessing reported violations, and, when necessary, for assigning and recommending 
appropriate penalties. 

56 
 
 
25.5.2 
Right to Disciplinary Proceeding 
Except in cases where temporary suspension is ordered by the Vice Chancellor, or in cases of alleged sexual 
harassment which are overseen by Sexual Harassment Inquiry Committee; please see the handbook 
section on Office of Accessibility & Inclusion for more information about this committee. In cases of pre-
approved penalties that administrative departments are allowed to impose, any disciplinary sanction may 
not be imposed without a disciplinary proceeding in accordance with the following University Disciplinary 
Procedures. 
 
25.5.3 
Initiation of Disciplinary Proceedings 
1. Complaint: Any member of the university community may file a written complaint of misconduct 
against a student, alumnus or organization alleging misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct or 
other published university policy or regulations prescribing a standard of student conduct. The 
Disciplinary Committee may also take up a case for determination suo moto (of its own accord). 
 
Complaints can be filed to the Disciplinary Committee Support Unit at dc@lums.edu.pk. It is desirable 
that complaints be filed as promptly as possible after gaining information about the alleged misconduct. 
If a matter is first presented to the Disciplinary Committee within one week of the end of an academic 
semester, it may be held for consideration in the following semester, including the summer semester, 
to prevent any delay in the case hearing. 
 
2. Review of Complaint: The Convener of the Disciplinary Committee shall review each complaint to 
determine whether it may be disposed of without institution of disciplinary proceedings. The Convener 
can decide on one of three courses of action: (a) dismiss the complaint, (b) refer the complaint to an 
administrative department for imposition of pre‐approved sanctions that the department is authorized 
to enforce, or (c) initiate disciplinary proceedings. 
 
3. Investigation: If the matter so requires, the Convener of the Disciplinary Committee may ask the DC 
investigator to conduct an investigation to gather evidence that will be presented to the Disciplinary 
Committee during the disciplinary proceedings. 
 
4. Summons: The Disciplinary Committee will inform the accused in writing of the reason for being 
summoned, and of a specific day and time when the accused is to appear before the Disciplinary 
Committee. 
 
5. Written Statement: The Disciplinary Committee will also require the accused to file a written statement 
before the formal disciplinary hearing, in which the accused will clarify his or her position on the 
accusation. An accused will normally be given 24 hours to file their statement. However, in cases that 
have to be dealt with on an urgent basis, this requirement may be waived. 
 
6. Obligation to Admit to Misconduct: At any stage of the Disciplinary Proceedings, the accused is under 
no obligation at any time to admit the misconduct alleged or to make any other statement at any 
meeting or hearing relevant to the misconduct alleged. However, the accused can be held liable to 
perjury for making false statements during the course of an investigation or during the disciplinary 
hearing. Any statement that the student or any representative of the organization makes in their 
written statement or during the course of investigation can be used against the student or organization 
under these Disciplinary Procedures. 

57 
 
 
7. Failure to Appear: The student accused of misconduct, or a student officer of the organization accused 
of misconduct will be expected to be present at the hearing before the Disciplinary Committee. If the 
student or a student officer of the organization fails to appear at the time and place designated for the 
hearing, the Disciplinary Committee shall proceed with the hearing if a majority of the Disciplinary 
Committee members present are satisfied that the student or organization has received adequate 
written notice. The Disciplinary Committee members will then proceed in the absence of the student 
or organization to hear and weigh the evidence in support of the alleged misconduct and render a 
decision. 
 
25.5.4 
Temporary Suspension 
Pending initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the Disciplinary Committee, the Vice Chancellor may at 
any time temporarily suspend a student from the University or deny a student readmission when the Vice 
Chancellor finds and believes from information coming to his or her attention that the presence of the 
student on the University campus would seriously disrupt the University or constitute a danger to the 
health, safety or welfare of persons on the campus. If a student is temporarily suspended by the Vice 
Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor shall promptly instruct the Disciplinary Committee to initiate appropriate 
disciplinary proceedings against the student within five working days after temporary suspension is 
imposed. If a student placed on temporary suspension is ultimately found not guilty of misconduct, such 
student shall be allowed, if at all possible, to make up academic work missed while on suspension. 
 
25.5.5 
Conduct of Hearings 
1. Nature of Hearing: The Convener of the Disciplinary Committee will decide whether the testimony of 
the accused is to be heard in a full committee hearing or is to be referred to a sub-committee. Only 
cases dealing with academic dishonesty may be referred to a sub- committee. In case the decision is 
taken by a sub- committee, it will be ratified in a full committee meeting before being communicated 
to the student. 
 
2. Quorum: The Quorum for a full committee hearing is half of its members, and that of a sub-committee 
hearing is at least two members. 
 
3. Advocate: The accused may be accompanied at the Committee hearing by an advocate, who must be 
a current student at LUMS. The advocate must render his or her services voluntarily and not charge 
the accused for this service. The same advocate cannot appear for two different defendants or 
witnesses in the same disciplinary case. The advocate may advise the accused, but may not directly 
participate in the hearing, unless requested by the Convener of the Disciplinary Committee. 
 
4. Witnesses or Amicus Curiae: At the hearing any person with information about the matter before the 
Disciplinary Committee may be requested to appear by the Disciplinary Committee. However, an 
accused or a complainant cannot name a witness without their consent.  
 
5. Status Pending Disciplinary Proceedings: During any disciplinary proceeding, the status of students or 
organizations accused of misconduct shall remain unchanged. Students accused of misconduct shall 
retain their right to be present on campus and attend classes, with suspension only considered by the 
Vice Chancellor if compelling reasons exist to protect the student's physical or emotional well-being, 
or the safety and welfare of the University community. Similarly, the status of organizations accused 

58 
 
of misconduct shall not be altered, unless the Vice Chancellor deems suspension necessary to 
safeguard the health, safety, or welfare of the University community. 
 
6. Conflict of Interest: If the complainant in a case is a member of the Disciplinary Committee, that 
member will not participate in the disciplinary proceedings. Moreover, if a member of the Disciplinary 
Committee feels that his or her relationship with any individual or organization involved in the 
proceeding would affect his or her ability to render a fair and impartial decision, such Disciplinary 
Committee member will request the Convener of the Committee to be excused from the proceedings. 
The Convener will decide whether to entertain such a request or not, based on the nature of 
relationship with the accused. 
 
The student accused of misconduct, or a student officer of the organization accused of misconduct 
may question any Disciplinary Committee member with regards to his or her attitude or knowledge 
about the disciplinary proceeding to be heard. If a member of the Committee is challenged for cause 
by the student or organization, the other members of the Committee present shall, without the 
presence of the challenged member, vote upon the challenge. If a majority of the members present 
vote to sustain the challenge, the challenged member shall be excused from further participation in 
the proceeding. The foregoing shall not relieve the Disciplinary Committee from the requirement of 
maintaining a quorum for the hearing as required above. 
 
7. Closed Hearings: All hearings of the Disciplinary Committee shall be closed to the public in order to 
comply with the requirements of privacy of proceedings. 
 
8. Evidentiary Rules: The Committee shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence applicable to a 
court of law. It may admit and give probative effect to evidence, including hearsay evidence, which 
possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their 
affairs. 
 
The Committee may only accept evidence that is disclosed to the accused. In exceptional cases, where 
a majority of the Committee is convinced that revealing the identity of a witness may subject the 
witness to retaliation, the Committee may decline to disclose the witness’s identity. In cases where the 
identity of the witness can only be concealed by withholding evidence from the accused, the evidence 
shall be inadmissible. The Committee shall not base its judgment on evidence provided by an 
undisclosed witness. 
 
9. Verbatim Record: The Disciplinary Committee may record the hearings to keep a record of the hearing 
for future reference. 
 
10. Burden of Proof: The University bears the responsibility of proving the alleged misconduct against a 
student or organization by a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing. 'Preponderance 
of the evidence' means that the evidence, when considered as a whole and assessed impartially, 
persuades the Disciplinary Committee that the alleged misconduct is more likely to have occurred than 
not. This determination does not rely on the quantity of witnesses but on the overall convincing nature 
of the evidence. If the evidence is equally balanced or favors the accused, the University has not met 
its burden of proof. The Disciplinary Committee should evaluate all relevant evidence, not just that 
provided by the University, to decide if the University has sufficiently proven its case. This includes 

59 
 
considering evidence that supports the University's position on a contested issue, even if this evidence 
is presented by someone other than the University. 
 
11. Decisions: The Disciplinary Committee deliberates and arrives at a decision by individual vote. In order 
to determine that a student has violated a University rule, a majority of the voting Disciplinary 
Committee members present must conclude that the evidence presented constitutes a clear and 
persuasive case in support of the charges against the student. If the student is found to have misled 
the Disciplinary Committee during the hearing, the Disciplinary Committee may take that fact into 
account in reaching a conclusion and assigning a penalty. 
 
In matters that have significant precedence value, the Convener of the Disciplinary Committee may 
delay the vote on a matter for ensuring better participation of Committee members, or to seek more 
evidence before the decision is made. 
 
If the voting members are evenly divided in establishing guilt on a particular case, the case must be 
reconsidered at the next meeting of the Disciplinary Committee. If at the second meeting at which the 
case is considered the regular voting members are still evenly divided, the matter shall be dismissed 
without prejudice. 
 
The decisions of the Committee shall be communicated to the accused in writing via email and letter. In 
some instances, the decision shall also be conveyed in person, in addition to the written communication. 
12. Mitigating and Aggravating Circumstances: The Disciplinary Committee may consider possible 
mitigating and aggravating factors listed below. This list is not exhaustive; the specific circumstances 
of a case may cause the Committee to consider additional factors. 
 
Examples of Mitigating Factors 
• 
Evidence of genuine lack of understanding 
• 
Unclear course policy or instructions. 
• 
The weight of the instrument or the amount of instrument that is plagiarized. 
• 
Cooperating with the Committee through substantial disclosure helps the DC reach its decision. For 
example, a student voluntarily admitting to the offense upfront, and providing useful information 
about it that was otherwise not accessible to the Committee, may be considered as substantial 
disclosure. 
 
Examples of Aggravating Factors: 
• 
Willfully misleading the Committee or falsification of testimony that can be proven by material 
evidence. 
• 
Attempt to conceal an offense after the initial offense has occurred. 
• 
Any repeat offence of a similar category. 
 
Factors that cannot be taken into consideration 
Student’s major, GPA, ignorance of Code of Conduct, academic stress, external effects of the penalty, and 
student’s plea of either “guilty” or “not guilty” 
 
 
 

60 
 
13. Privacy 
The sanctions imposed on a student or alumnus are recorded in a manner that respects the privacy of the 
individual and will not be released publicly. However, this information is made available to the following: 
 
a. The original complainant. 
b. The student’s faculty advisor. 
c. Members of the Disciplinary Committee. 
d. Parents of the student or alumnus. 
e. Dean of the relevant school. 
f. 
Vice Chancellor. 
g. Registrar’s office. 
h. Any other office that is required to ensure the implementation of the imposed sanction. 
 
The information about the sanction is also kept on record of the disciplinary committee for future reference 
and for identifying repeat offenders, as well as the record of the TA coordinator so that they can check 
whether a student is eligible to become a TA or not. 
 
25.5.6 
Sanctions for Non-Academic Offences 
For violations of University-‐wide rules of conduct, members of the community are subject to several kinds 
of penalties. The applicability and exact nature of each penalty vary on the severity of the offense and its 
circumstances. For violation of LUMS values (Section 2), violation of guidelines of general conduct (Section 
3) and non-‐academic misconduct (Section 4), the following sanctions may be imposed: 
 
1. Warning: A formal admonition that does not become part of an individual's permanent record, but 
that may be taken into account in judging the seriousness of any future violation. 
 
2. Disciplinary Probation / Loss of privilege of being TA: A more serious admonition assigned for a definite 
amount of time, up to two years. It implies that any future violation, of whatever kind, during that 
time, may be grounds for suspension, required withdrawal, or in especially serious cases, for expulsion, 
from the University. 
 
Disciplinary probation appears on an individual's permanent record at the University (but not on the 
transcript) and may be disclosed by the University in response to requests for which the student has given 
permission. 
 
3. Educational Sanctions, such as letters of apology, educational workshops, essays or research papers. 
 
4. Reimbursement or Fine: This penalty ought to be awarded only in cases involving vandalism, disorderly 
conduct and alcohol-‐related infractions which result in damage to University and/or private property 
of others. 
 
5. Relocation within or removal from university housing: When appropriate to the infraction, particularly 
in instances involving anti-‐social behaviour having a serious impact on the residential community, 
removal from University housing or relocation within University housing may be awarded as a penalty. 
In the case of a first-year student or a sophomore, this penalty will be imposed only after consultation 
with the director of the student's residences. 
 

61 
 
6. Withholding of degree: In cases involving seniors or graduate students, the University may withhold a 
student's degree for a specified period of time. In such a case, the student may be permitted to remain 
on campus to complete his or her academic requirements for the degree. 
 
7. Work hours or Community service 
 
8. Behavioural Requirement: Written conditions imposed by a judicial board or a judicial officer that 
establish specified requirements for the student or organization. This may include a restraining order, 
that is, a prohibition to approach a certain individual or to refrain from certain acts. 
 
9. Suspension of privileges. 
 
10. Required Withdrawal: Removal from membership in the University for at least the period of time 
specified by the suspension, with the suspension to continue until certain conditions, stipulated by the 
Disciplinary Committee, have been fulfilled. These conditions may include restitution of damages, 
formal apology, or counseling. 
 
11. Suspension or dissolution of a student organization 
 
12. Separation: Removal from membership in, or employment by, the University for a specified period of 
time, typically a semester or a full academic year. This encourages reflection, self-improvement, 
safeguards campus safety, and fosters accountability to deter future misconduct. 
 
13. Expulsion from University: Permanent removal from membership in the University without hope of 
readmission to the community. 
 
14. Censure: University censure can be added to any of the other penalties listed above, except warning. 
Censure indicates the University's desire to underscore the seriousness of the violation and the 
absence of mitigating circumstances and to convey that seriousness in response to future authorized 
inquiries about the given individual's conduct or character. 
 
15. Disciplinary sanctions will not normally affect the status of financial aid of a student. However, if good 
conduct conditions are imposed by an external donor as a condition for award of financial aid, then 
the financial aid award may be curtailed or suspended by the Office of Financial Aid, to comply with 
donor’s conditions. 
 
25.5.7 
Sanctions for Academic Dishonesty 
The Disciplinary Committee will select from the following set of penalties when dealing with cases of 
plagiarism, sorted by decreasing severity. A guilty verdict puts a student on probation, and a repeat 
academic offense will be given harsher penalty. 
• 
Expulsion from the university 
• 
F in the course + separation for one year 1 
• 
F in the course + separation for one semester  
• 
F in the course 
• 
Zero in the Instrument2 + Double Letter Grade Reduction (DLGR) 
• 
Zero in the Instrument + Letter Grade Reduction (LGR) 
• 
Zero in the Instrument + Grade Reduction (GR) 
• 
Zero in the Instrument3 

62 
 
• 
Warning Letter 
1 Separation will be effective from the subsequent semester. For graduating students, degree will be delayed. Summer 
semester will not count as penalty for one semester separation but will count in one-‐year separation. 
2 “Zero in the Instrument” means zero will be given in the specific academic activity in which plagiarism is committed. For 
example, if a portion of Assignment 3 in a course is plagiarized, zero will be given in Assignment 3, not in all the assignments 
of that course. 
3 In cases where the instrument has very high weight, zero in the instrument may be a more severe penalty than just grade 
reduction. In such cases, the Committee may award only grade reduction after the instrument has been graded. 
 
25.5.8 
Disciplinary Appeals Committee (DAC) 
 
The Disciplinary Appeals Committee (DAC) serves as an official platform for students to lodge appeals and 
seek a review of decisions made by the disciplinary committee. As an appellant body, its primary 
responsibility is reviewing the appeals to dispute the decision of a disciplinary proceeding. 
The DAC reserves the right to interpret and enforce academic regulations; it also has the right to approve 
of exceptions to these regulations as necessary. Students who wish to appeal against a decision made by 
the Academic or Non-academic Disciplinary Committee can approach the DAC by contacting 
dac@lums.edu.pk within 72 hours of receiving the decision of a disciplinary proceeding (Academic or Non-
Academic) i.e., from the date of decision by the Disciplinary Committee. The DAC, if it accepts the appeal 
for hearing, shall follow the same procedural rules regarding conduct of hearings as applicable to the 
Disciplinary Committee. 
 
The purpose of an appeal is not to reexamine the factual aspects of the disciplinary case. An appeal does 
not serve as a means to review the factual information of a disciplinary case. It is important to note that 
the purpose of the appeals process is not to reopen all cases from the beginning. A case may only be 
reconsidered if the appellant believes that one or more of the following conditions apply: 
 
• They were not given an adequate opportunity to present their side during the investigation of their 
offense. 
• There is reasonable evidence that the decision of the Disciplinary Committee is tainted with bias or 
there is an absence of procedural fairness on any other account. 
• New and compelling evidence has surfaced that was not available during the original investigation 
conducted by the Disciplinary Committee. 
 
If the Disciplinary Appeals Committee accepts an appeal for a hearing, it will adhere to the same procedural 
rules that govern the conduct of hearings as applied to the Disciplinary Committee 
Letters of appeal that simply express dissatisfaction with the judgment of the Disciplinary Committee 
without providing evidence of a flawed investigative process, bias on the part of the judges, or new 
evidence will be rejected. Disagreement with the decision, feeling that the penalty is harsh, or experiencing 
negative emotions such as disappointment, grief, or shock are not legitimate grounds for appeal. Likewise, 
factors such as good academic performance before or after the offense, character witnesses, or claims that 
the offense was a one-time occurrence are not considered valid grounds for appeal. 
  
The Disciplinary Committee (Academic and Non-Academic) has the role to impose penalties from a 
predefined list of sanctions, but it should be noted that this list is not exhaustive. In the case there is no 

63 
 
defined penalty for a particular misconduct, the Disciplinary Committee retains the right to sanction based 
on the principles and guidelines outlined in the code of conduct. 
 
Students have the right to request an appeal of a decision made by the Disciplinary Committee (DC), and 
the Disciplinary Appeals Committee (DAC) conducts a thorough review of each case. The DAC carefully 
considers the grounds presented in the appeal and proceeds to either approve the appeal, leading to a 
revision of the decision, or reject the appeal if it does not meet the criteria outlined or lacks substantive 
grounds for appeal. 
 
25.5.9 
Sexual Harassment  
Harassment is a violation of human rights, is demeaning to human dignity and is unacceptable in a healthy 
work and academic environment, specifically one in which scholarly pursuit may flourish. LUMS will not 
tolerate sexual harassment of any member of the LUMS community and will strive through education and 
deterrence to create an environment free from such behaviour on its premises. 
 
LUMS is guaranteed to be a safe space for all those who inhabit the institution in any capacity. To this end, 
any harassment, sexual or otherwise, is strictly prohibited under LUMS policy and national law. 
 
Sexual harassment often (but not necessarily) involves a power dynamic, for instance between a supervisor 
and employee, a teacher and a student, or junior and senior colleagues. These cases may involve an 
exchange for some benefit or some threat of harm, or they may simply take advantage of the power 
dynamic to create or condone an environment of harassment. Unfortunately, in such cases, the power 
dynamic not only helps create a space conducive to harassment but may also make it more difficult to 
report. 
 
“Harassment” includes, directly or by implication, 
i. any unwelcome, non-consensual sexual gesture, advance or activity, 
ii. persistent and unwelcome flirting, request for sexual favors, sexual innuendo, 
iii. verbal or written communication (whether electronic or otherwise) of a loaded nature, 
iv. non-consensual physical conduct of a sexual nature including assault, exploitation, and sexual 
violence, 
v. sexually demeaning attitudes, 
vi. stalking or otherwise interfering with someone’s sexual privacy, such as taking pictures, videotaping, 
viewing or sharing explicit images without consent, 
vii. causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive campus 
environment, or 
viii. the attempt or threat to punish the complainant for refusal to comply to requests for sexual favour, 
or 
ix. the placing of a sexual favour as a condition for employment, promotion, grades or evaluation of a 
person’s professional engagement in any activity. 
 
Sexual harassment can be physical or psychological in nature. It may be perpetrated using electronic media 
as well as in person. An aggregation of incidents can constitute sexual harassment even if one of the 
incidents considered on its own would not constitute harassment. 
 
Sexual harassment is especially egregious and will be sanctioned as such if the Inquiry Committee finds 
that the Accused knew or ought reasonably to have known that the Complainant/victim was in an impaired 

64 
 
or incapacitated state. Impairment of the Accused, for instance due to the use of any illegal substances, 
shall not diminish their responsibility for harassment under this Policy. 
 
This list is not exhaustive, and individual behaviours may be found to constitute harassment by the Inquiry 
Committee using this definition as a guideline. 
 
The committee can be reached with complaints of sexual harassment at harassment@lums.edu.pk . For 
further details regarding basic terms, policies, and procedures regarding sexual harassment at LUMS, 
please refer to the Office of Accessibility and Inclusion under the Section 3: Administrative Offices. 
 
26. Academic Standing 
Academic standing is a measure of the student's academic achievement, relative to his/her degree 
requirements. It determines the eligibility to continue in the chosen academic plan and to qualify for 
graduation. 
 
To remain in good academic standing, students are required to maintain a minimum CGPA of 2.00 at the 
end of each regular semester and during their study. 
 
26.1 Academic Warning 
Academic warning (unlike probation based only on CGPA) is based on the regular semester GPA as well. A 
warning letter is issued to indicate that students must seriously focus on their studies, as they run the risk 
of being put on probation if they do not improve their academic performance.  
 
Warning letters are issued: 
• 
If the Semester GPA in any regular semester falls below 2.00, regardless of the CGPA. 
• 
If CGPA is below 2.50 but is above 2.00. 
 
26.2 Probation and Separation 
The academic performance of a student is closely monitored by the Office of the Registrar, especially during 
his/her warning and probation period. Students who fail to demonstrate a marked improvement in their 
academic performance while on probation are separated from their respective academic programmes.  
Students may go on probation without receiving an academic warning beforehand. 
 
A student is placed on academic probation as listed below: 
• 
If the CGPA falls below 2.00 at the end of any regular semester. 
• 
If the CGPA of the student is below 2.00 for two consecutive regular semesters (Fall and Spring), then 
s/he is separated from the programme. 
 
Note: If the academic performance of a student improves and CGPA is equal to or above 2.00 then the student 
regains good academic status.  
 
Probation/Separation Conditions for First year students 
If Semester GPA in any semester falls below 2.00, regardless of the CGPA the student is advised (by 
respective department/faculty advisor) to take less semester workload. Such students will not be allowed 
to take more than 14 credit hours in the semester. 
 

65 
 
In the case of first year student, if the CGPA falls below 2.00 at the end of the Fall semester (first semester 
after admission), the student is placed on probation in the next regular semester, i.e. Spring semester. After 
the Spring semester, if CGPA remains below 2.00 then the student is separated from the academic 
programme with immediate effect. 
 
Please recall that first year students are not allowed to take the first semester off. If a first-year student 
while on probation takes the second semester off, s/he is placed on academic probation in the semester 
that s/he re-joins. 
 
 Probation/Separation Conditions in the Subsequent Years at LUMS 
In the subsequent years, the probation period can be extended over a maximum of two regular semesters 
(Fall or Spring). 
 
To this end, Probation Semester GPA (PSGPA), which is the cumulative CGPA since the beginning of 
probation, is tracked. The PSGPA ascertains the student’s performance after probation and determines 
whether student continues to be on probation or is to be separated. Figure 1 presents these conditions. 
 
Probation is extended for only one regular semester for students having a PSGPA equal to or more than 
2.50 at the end of first regular probation semester, while the CGPA is still below 2.00. 
 
If the CGPA remains below 2.00 at the end of second probation semester, the student is separated from 
the programme. 
 
Students on probation, who are allowed to withdraw from a semester, can resume their studies with their 
probationary status unchanged. Please note that decisions regarding academic standing are taken at the 
end of regular semesters only.  
 
Senior Year Students: For courses, which are spread over two consecutive semesters (e.g., Senior Projects), 
grades are finalized at the end of the course. Students will receive the same finalized grade in each 
semester over which the course was spread. As a result, if the student’s CGPA falls below 2.00 in two 
consecutive semesters, the student is separated from the programme with immediate effect. In such cases 
separation from the programme takes place without the student being placed on probation. 

66 
 
Curb on Co-Curricular Activities for Students on Probation 
For students on probation, involvement in co-curricular activities should be limited till the regaining of good 
academic standing. Students on probation cannot take part in extracurricular activities and events which 
will result in them missing graded instruments at LUMS. 
 
Students on probation cannot serve as office bearers or shoulder responsibility in any student organization, 
club, society or extracurricular activity. It is the student’s responsibility to inform the respective 
organization and resign from such a position. Failing to act responsibly may expose the student to 
disciplinary proceedings. 
 
Probation and Separation Letters 
Students who are placed on probation or are separated from the Programme are informed via email and 
letters. Probation and separation letters are also dispatched to the students through courier service on 
their mailing addresses available in Zambeel. 
 
26.3 Readmission upon Separation 
Students separated from the programme based on academic performance are eligible to apply for 
readmission. For further information, refer to the Readmission Conditions. 
 
Academic Standing Committee (ASC) 
The ASC is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the academic regulations of the university and 
approving exceptions to them as circumstances warrant. The committee is responsible for taking up cases 
regarding the readmission and academic standing of vulnerable students.   
 
The committee, following the University defined guidelines, has the discretion to accept or reject 
applications. Readmission is offered only in those cases in which there is clear evidence that the causes 
leading to poor academic performance in the past have been removed. 
 
All readmission applications should be addressed to the Convener, Academic Standing Committee and sent 
to the Office of the Registrar, LUMS for deliberation by the committee. 
 
If senior year students, i.e., students who have completed 95 or more credit hours, are eligible for 
separation (For Law students, the senior category is determined at 118 or more credit hours), the Academic 
Standing Committee may recommend continued probation, suspension (mandatory separation for a fixed 
number of semesters) or any other conditions applicable on a case-to-case basis on the recommendation 
of the school.  
 
In cases where senior category readmitted students are eligible for separation; the above-mentioned policy 
is not applicable. The conditions specified in their readmission letter are applied to such students and they 
are separated with immediate effect. 
 
Continuation of Semester after receiving Separation Letter 
Students subsequently separated from the programme based on their academic performance but enrolled 
in the Summer semester (immediately after separation), are given the option to drop the course without 

67 
 
any penalty, if they inform the Office of the Registrar before mid-semester. In such cases, the courses are 
removed from the transcript and fee is refunded.  
However, if the student does not opt to drop courses taken in the Summer semester, the courses will show 
on the transcript with the grades assigned by the instructor. In case of readmission, the Summer course 
grades are not counted towards the CGPA, but the credits are transferred subject to meeting the 
readmission criteria. 
 
The above policy regarding Summer Semester is also applicable in case of final separation of a student. 
 
Readmission Conditions 
• 
Students are only eligible to apply for readmission within 2 weeks from the issuance date of the 
separation letter or as specified in the separation letter. 
• 
Students who are separated on academic grounds and then are readmitted are placed on academic 
probation for the rest of their stay at LUMS.  
• 
Readmission fee is applicable as per University policy.  
• 
Students can be readmitted only once. 
• 
Students separated from the programme based on disciplinary action will not be considered for 
readmission, nor will they be eligible to apply as fresh candidates. 
• 
It is mandatory for students separated from the programme on academic grounds to take next regular 
semester off. 
• 
All courses taken by a student at LUMS will show on the transcript, even if the student has been 
readmitted.  
• 
Courses with grade C+ or above are given as credits on readmission. 
• 
Credit hours of courses for which credit is given on readmission count towards the graduation 
requirements, but the course grades are not included in the calculation of CGPA and specialization 
GPA. 
• 
Courses for which credit hours are given (after readmission) are not to be repeated. 
• 
After readmission, in the first regular semester (Fall or Spring), the students are required to obtain a 
minimum semester GPA of 2.50. Please note that as per University policy, the academic standing 
decisions are taken at the end a regular semester. They are required to maintain a minimum CGPA of 
2.00, thereafter, at the end of each regular semester to continue with the programme. In case their 
CGPA dips below 2.00 in any regular semester, they are separated from the programme without any 
warning. 
• 
In case of readmission, the student must finish the undergraduate programme within the maximum 
allowable time for the respective programme i.e., six years (BS/BA-BSc) and seven years (B.A.-LLB) from 
the original date of joining LUMS.  
• 
Readmitted students who are subsequently finally separated from the programme on academic 
grounds cannot apply as fresh candidates. 
• 
Once a student has been separated from LUMS (at any stage) on academic grounds and has not been 
readmitted, s/he is allowed to apply as a fresh candidate only once.  
 
26.4 After Withdrawal or Separation 
Students who withdraw, are separated or leave the University without informing the Office of the Registrar 
at any time during the year may apply for online clearance using Zambeel self-service. Upon successful 
online clearance from all respective departments, the student is entitled to get his/her final settlement 

68 
 
done from LUMS. In case a student does not get clearance or does not complete the clearance process, the 
security deposit is not refunded. 
 
Online clearance is mandatory for the student to be eligible for the issuance of any official university 
document.  
 
27.  Academic Honours at LUMS 
Academic honours encompass end of semester recognition, end of the year recognition and all the way up 
to honours and medals at the time of graduation. Please note that repeated courses do not count towards 
honours and awards, throughout the degree tenure. 
 
The University has defined policies to recognize high achievers and best performing students as discussed 
in detail below: 
 
27.1   Honours 
At the time of graduation, excellence in academic performance is recognized, according to the below listed 
criteria: 
• 
Graduation with High Distinction CGPA of 3.8 and above, mentioned on transcript and award of High 
Distinction plaque and certificate. 
• 
Graduation with Distinction CGPA of 3.6 to 3.79, mentioned on transcript and award of Distinction 
plaque and certificate. 
• 
Graduation with High Merit CGPA of 3.30 to 3.59, mentioned only on transcript. 
• 
Graduation with Merit CGPA of 3.10 to 3.29, mentioned only on transcript. 
 
27.2   Medals 
• 
At the time of graduation, all graduating students compete for medals/awards.  
• 
If an external transfer student secures the highest GPA among the students of his/her graduating major 
s/he will be considered for awarding of medal along with the any other regular student as per his/her 
performance and eligibility criteria.  
• 
However, if a student who obtains admission at LUMS with 58 credits (after completing 58 credits at 
the host university) and takes another exchange semester at another university and does not complete 
72 credits at LUMS, will not be considered for a medal. 
 
National Management Foundation (NMF) Gold and Silver Medal for Overall Top Positions  
• 
The student with the best academic record, having the highest CGPA within the range 3.90 to 4.00, 
receives a gold medal for overall first position.  
• 
The student with the second highest CGPA, which should not be less than 3.60, receives a silver medal 
for overall second position.  
 
In case there is a tie for the overall first position and the overall second position, the tie is broken according 
to the following University defined criteria: 
• 
CGPA is extended up to 6 decimal places for comparison; the student with the highest CGPA thus 
established, is eligible for the medal.

28. Graduation Tracking 
To fulfil the graduation requirements students must be in good academic standing. They cannot graduate 
while on academic probation. 
 
The process for graduation is defined below: 
 
28.1   Graduation Audit Form (GAF) 
To assess if all the graduation requirements have been fulfilled, students in their final semester are required 
to confirm in Zambeel that they wish to graduate. 
 
Only the students who complete their graduation requirements in their final semester, i.e., the Spring 
semester (in case of late/early graduates in the prior Summer or Fall semester) of the academic year and 
submit their Graduation Audit Form (GAF) within the announced deadline, are allowed to participate in the 
upcoming annual convocation. Once the GAF has been submitted and requirements have been verified by 
the respective department/school and the Office of the Registrar, the student’s course enrollment is 
locked.  GAF once verified and approved by the department will not be reverted. 
 

71 
 
Please note that a different major other than the one assigned in Zambeel cannot be declared at the time 
of submission of GAF. This rule holds true even if the student has fulfilled the graduation requirements for 
that particular major. 
 
All students who are eligible for graduation in a particular year, irrespective of their enrollment year, are 
in competition for graduation honours. 
 
Students who are involved in a disciplinary case and have not fulfilled the penalty may not be allowed to 
participate in the convocation ceremony.  
 
Students with their status on hold by the Financial Aid Department may be allowed to attend the 
convocation ceremony. For all such students, the academic documents remain on hold till the University 
decisions in their regard are fulfilled and the University clearance process is complete. However, clearance 
of financial dues is necessary in order to attend the convocation.  
 
Students wishing to withdraw their GAF application, s/he should inform the Office of the Registrar within 
14 days after the semester final examination week. Withdrawal requests after the deadline will not be 
entertained. 
 
28.2   Other Graduation Clearance Requirements 
The clearance of graduating students by all departments at LUMS is done through Zambeel.  The Office of 
Student Support Services (SSS), which falls under the Office of Student Affairs, initiates the clearance 
process for the tentative graduating students.  
 
Students need to fulfil the following requirements for Graduation Clearance: 
• 
Submit an undertaking and return the specified items to the respective departments, latest by the 
deadline announced by the OSA.  
• 
Return all borrowed books and other issued material to LUMS library, student clubs, IST etc. 
• 
Clear any outstanding dues. 
 
If any item is pending against a graduating student, the respective department will update the requisite 
status in the student Zambeel self-service. Each student is able to view status of their clearance in Zambeel. 
If dues are pending, student will receive fee voucher in his/her self-service. To avoid any hindrance in 
graduation, the dues must be cleared within the stipulated deadline. 
 
Only students fulfilling the clearance requirements are allowed to attend the annual convocation and 
receive degrees. 
 
Students who do not wish to attend the Annual Convocation after confirmation should inform the Office 
of the Registrar within 14 days after the semester final examination week. 
 
Students willing to attend the convocation after declining the initial request to attend also need to inform 
the Office of the Registrar within 14 days after the semester final examination week. 
 
Note: Any request after the above-mentioned deadlines will not be entertained. 
 

72

from attending the convocation by the relevant Committee. 
 
In case of ineligibility to graduate, students are informed by the Office of the Registrar. 
 
28.4   Name on Transcript and Degree 
After admission to LUMS is confirmed, student profiles are created in Zambeel. The information in the 
profiles is transferred from the on-line admission application filled in by the admitted student. After 
enrollment and registration, it is the prime responsibility of the student to review his/her respective profile 
during the LUMS Orientation Week. If there is any discrepancy, especially in the name and/or the date of 
birth, the student should get it rectified by submitting a duly filled Personal Information Form at 
helpdeskro@lums.edu.pk available at RO Portal. 
 
The name on the transcript and degree is printed from the information available in Zambeel, which is 
considered final.

the date of birth of a student must be the same throughout his/her educational testimonials such as 
Matriculation, Intermediate, Bachelors and Masters onwards to PhD Degrees/Transcripts, as well as on

for his/her degree prior to the convocation. The Office of the Registrar charges the student and issues the 
DBC. This degree is printed with the text “Degree before Convocation” (DBC). The DBC must be returned 
before or upon receiving the regular degree at convocation. The charges for the DBC are in addition to the 
convocation charges and are not refunded once the DBC is returned.

ACF 494 – Internship: 4 Credit hrs. [Mandatory] 
ACF internship (6-8 weeks) is a mandatory degree requirement for all ACF students and students get four 
semester credit hours for this internship. A minimum of 6 weeks’ duration is mandatory to complete the 
internship requirement and partial credit will not be given. Students will require prior approval regarding 
the nature of the internship from the ACF Internship Coordinator before taking it up.  
The pursuit of an internship is a serious responsibility. During their interaction with the host organizations, 
students represent the Suleman Dawood School of Business as well as themselves. Their conduct must be 
representative of the values and norms of Suleman Dawood School of Business. Students are expected to 
adhere to normal working hours and be extremely attentive towards office timings, organizational norms 
and the quality of output required by their host organizations. 
 

80 
 
At the end of the internship, students are required to submit a written report documenting the whole 
learning experience as thoroughly as possible. It gives them confidence that they have actually made the 
best of this opportunity and gives them a chance to reflect on their experiences in a more structured 
manner. Additional guidelines on the required content of the report are provided to students when they 
start their internships. Students who were unable to undertake the Mandatory ACF Internship till their 
junior year summer semester won't be able to graduate on time without the mandatory internship. 
Students opting for an ACF Internship during Summer Semester will not be eligible for enrollment in any 
course. In case of such activity, the department reserves the right to drop the student from the course(s). 
 
The report plays a significant role in determining the pass/fail grade for the internship and must be 
submitted within a week of the internship ending. The report should not exceed 3500 words. Once a 
student successfully enrolls in the internship, it is his/her responsibility to continuously check his/her LMS 
and submit reports on time. As per policy, if a student missed the deadline, he/she will not be given 
permission to submit it late. 
 
The ACF internship incurs charges following the university policy and is billed on a per-credit-hour basis. 
The credit hours associated with the ACF internship will be recorded during the Summer Semester, 
concurrent with the period of internship pursuit. 
 
Eligibility Criteria:

MGS 493/494 - Internship: 3 Credit hrs. [Elective] 
Given below are the guidelines that drive the internship programme for the Management Science (MGS) 
major at Suleman Dawood School of Business (SDSB). Internship is recommended as an important practical 
experience, allowing students the opportunity to synthesize their in-class academic learning with real world 
organizational practice. As an added advantage, the summer internship will give MGS students the 
advantage of the job market with some work experience related to their major under their belts. 
 
The MGS internship is billable and is charged on a per credit hrs basis as per the university policy. 
 
Background Considerations 
1. Compensation (credits and payment) 
The student compensation for the MGS internship (credit hour terms) be fixed at 3 credit hours 
(equivalent to one undergraduate course, and thereby requiring an equivalent amount of effort). 
Monetary payments by organizations are left at their discretion. 
 
2. Internship Objectives 
• Apply business concepts and decision-making tools to real-world scenarios/problems 
• Increase proficiency in a specific business: such as human resources management, operations 
management, marketing, accounting, economics, finance, etc. 
• Develop and improve business skills in communication, technology and teamwork. 
• Observe (and possibly participate) in business operations and decision-making. 
• Meet professional role models and potential mentors who can provide guidance, feedback, and 
support. 
• Expand network of professional relationships and contacts. 
• Develop a solid work ethic and professional conduct, as well as a commitment to ethical conduct 
and social responsibility. 
 
3. Target Organizations  
Given the unique skillset acquired by MGS scholars by their Junior year, placements are made at 
organizations where students are able to apply some of the tools they have learnt during the course 
of their studies. The Career Services Office (CSO) will match identified host organizations to student 
profiles and their work preferences. However, students are also encouraged to bring in their own 
contacts in prospective organizations for this purpose. 
 
4. Time of Internship and Credit 
The internship will take place during the student’s Junior or Senior year during the Summer break. The 
internship is 6-8 weeks long, and 3 credits are awarded for its completion. As a rule of thumb, at least 
six weeks of continuous work at the host organization’s premises (or recommended site) is given a full 
credit. Partial credit will not be given. Students are expected to adhere to normal working hours and 
be extremely attentive towards office timings, organizational norms and the quality of output required 
by their host organizations. The pursuit of an internship is a serious responsibility. During their 
interaction with the host organizations, students represent the Suleman Dawood School of Business 
as well as themselves. Their conduct must be representative of the values and norms of Suleman 
Dawood School of Business. Students opting for an MGS Internship during Summer Semester will not 
be eligible for enrollment in any course. In case of such activity, the department reserves the right to 
drop the student from the course/s. 

91 
 
5. Assurance of Continued Learning during the Internship 
To ensure that an internship continues as a learning situation and that the intended relationship 
between intern and host organization continues during the internship tenure, 
(i) The student is encouraged to seek the faculty sponsor’s assistance if any problems of 
communication arise or if he/ she finds that learning opportunities are being reduced or restricted. 
(ii) Several reports are required to be submitted by the student to the CSO at the start of the 
internship, during the internship and after its completion. Details are provided by the Programme 
Coordination Office (PCO) - SDSB. Internships will not be given credit without the submission of 
these deliverables. 
(iii) The faculty sponsor/ CSO may make site visits during the internship, and feedback is obtained by 
work supervisors periodically. 
 
Reports Required: 
1. Internship Proposal/Design Statement 
Students are expected to be partially responsible for the design of the internship undertaking. It is 
recommended that students prepare a short ‘internship design statement’ which should be prepared 
in tandem with their supervisor at the host organization. This is submitted alongside the one-week 
report. 
 
The proposal should contain the following elements: 
• 
Career goal of student 
• 
Learning objectives for the internship (the “Internship Objectives” in I-2) 
• 
Description of place of internship (and on-site work, if any) and functional area within which 
placement has been done. 
• 
Name, designation and contact of supervisor. 
• 
Expected work to be completed during the internship. 
• 
The student’s preparation for the internship (such as related coursework covering the 
industry, if any) 
• 
Additional comments, if any. 
 
2. Approval Procedures: Internship output and evaluation for credits 
At the end of the internship, students are required to write an 8-10-page report (1.5 spaced, 11 font 
size, printed on both sides, with annexures), assessing one or more aspect of the organization that they 
were exposed to and their detailed output therein. The report must clearly state the nature of work 
undertaken, lessons learnt, and the output given to the host organization. This report must be routed 
to the faculty supervisor through the CSO Office within a week of the internship ending.  Once a student 
successfully enrolls in the internship, it is his/her responsibility to continuously check his/her LMS and 
submit reports on time. As per policy, if a student missed the deadline, he/she will not be given 
permission to submit it late. 
 
Students must also submit a concise one-page summary of their experiences within the organization. 
This is a separate document from the internship report. This would include a personal evaluation of 
whether they felt this was a worthwhile experience, and how it could be improved. This is routed to 
the faculty supervisor through the CSO Office as well. 
 

92 
 
The host organization will also be requested to fill an evaluation form giving feedback on student’s 
behavior, the quality of the output and professionalism and whether the internship met their own 
expectations. 
Partial credit for incomplete internships will not be given. Credits are given once the faculty supervisor 
is satisfied with the internship visit/call, host organization’s evaluation of the student and the final 
internship report. 
 
General Rules and Policies 
Senior Year Project (SPROJ) / Independent Study (IS) Policy 
Please refer to Policy No. 8: Directed Course Work (Courses Requiring Exceptional Method of Registration) 
under Section 1: ‘Undergraduate Programme Policies and Regulations’ for university-wide policies 
applicable to Directed Course Work. 
 
In addition to the information given in the policy, further details about logistics of SPROJ/IS/DCW are given 
below: 
Senior Projects and Independent Studies are intended to provide students with an opportunity to integrate 
and apply what they have learned from the courses in their major programmes. It should demonstrate an 
ability to formulate an original research question/problem along with the appropriate research methods 
to investigate the question posed. The study should report findings and explain their implications and 
ramifications in detail. 
 
The form of the Senior Project /Independent Study varies with the substance of the student's major 
programme and the student's specific learning goals. 
 
Some forms which a Senior Project/ Independent Study may take are as follows: 
• 
An original Research Project using a method such as surveys or interviews. 
• 
An original research question about an organization’s management or financial reporting practices. 
• 
A critical review of the scholarly literature on some aspect of the student's major field. 
• 
An analysis of a company’s financial or management process. 
• 
A paper based on an internship with a business or a non-profit organization, detailing or critically 
analyzing some management issues. 
 
These examples are mere suggestions for guidance purpose only and are not meant to be exhaustive in 
any way. Students are encouraged to be creative and should come up with a project that will contribute to 
the existing body of knowledge.   
 
The Senior Project / Independent Study must be completed in the student's last year / Senior year. 
 
The process of planning a Senior Project/ Independent Study should begin by the start of the semester 
prior to the semester in which the student is registering for the project. However, it is useful to start 
thinking about it even earlier as prior to the registering of courses, the students are required to submit a 
DCW online application in Zambeel; so, completion of below listed steps 1-5 one semester before will assist 
students in smooth enrollment of not only DCW but also that semester’s requisite courses. To enhance 
learning outcomes students should work closely with faculty supervisors in the process of planning and 
carrying out the project as detailed below.  
 

93 
 
1. Select a topic and the potential supervisor at least one semester before students plan to begin 
working on the project. Selecting a topic will involve three elements: choosing the subject students will 
be working on, the approach to the subject, and the form the project will take. The process of selecting 
a topic should involve consultation with the proposed supervisor. Full time, Visiting & Adjunct faculty 
members can supervise Senior Projects and Independent Studies at SDSB. 
 
2. Write a proposal before the semester in which students plan to complete the project. The project 
proposal explains what the project is all about, how students plan to carry it out, and what students 
hope to learn by doing it. The proposal should specify the following: 
 
• 
The questions students want to answer or problems they want to address 
• 
How students plan to address them, i.e., the form their project will take 
• 
The methods that students plan to use, e.g., statistical analysis, archival research, textual analysis, 
qualitative research, etc. 
• 
Materials students intend to use (a bibliography will often answer this question) 
• 
The courses & experiences that have prepared students to undertake this project 
• 
The area that students think this proposal should be counted towards. 
• 
The number of credit hours’ students are hoping to gain from this Senior Project / Independent Study  
• 
A rough timeline for the completion of the project 
• 
The scope of work to be undertaken by each member of the group  
 
3. Work with the supervisor to: 
i) 
Make any revisions needed to clarify the project proposal, and 
ii) Identify an area of ACF OR MGS where the project should be ideally counted towards. 
 
4. BIN Allocation: 
Both the ACF and MGS SPROJs are hereby incorporated into the UFE BIN. Consequently, the 
completion of ACF and MGS Elective BINs will no longer include the aforementioned SPROJs. 
This policy is to be applied retrospectively, superseding all SPROJ-related policies delineated in 
preceding handbooks 
 
5. Approval from the department: The department will review the proposal and if needed call a meeting 
to discuss the proposal. Based on the results of this meeting, the department will finalize the following: 
i) 
The number of credit hours (3 to 4) for Senior Project spanned over a semester and 6 for a year (1 to 
2) for Independent Studies. 
ii) Any suggestions on scope of the work. 
 
6. Registration for Directed Course Work on Zambeel: The RO announces registration of Direct Course 
Work before the commencement of enrollment phase I & II. The students will register for the Directed 
Course Work through the online module from their Zambeel self-service. The DCW requests will be 
sent to the Undergraduate Programme Coordination Office and the respective supervising faculty. 
After their approval, the requests will be forwarded to the RO for further processing.

7. Grading Methods: It is expected that the Directed Course Work will require significant work from the 
students to justify the credit units assigned to the project. In general, same grades are given to the 
entire group. However, at the discretion of the instructor, different grades may be awarded to group 
members based on objective evidence of differential performance. The instructor may use 
presentation, viva or other such means along with the written report to assess the students’ 
performance.

Major Declaration/Specialization 
The SDSB undergraduate batch of 2025 will have the option of declaring their major (either ACF or MGS) 
at the end of Spring semester of the First year. In case of capacity constraints, some students may not get 
the major of their preferred choice. The criteria for major allocation are based on the CGPA of the students 
at the end of Spring semester of the First year. 
 
The students do have the option to revisit their decision of major choice upon the closure of the Sophomore 
year and are required to apply through the Major Change Form to process the change. 
 
Interschool Transfer Policy - SDSB 
Interschool transfers to Suleman Dawood School of Business (SDSB) may be applicable in case of the 
following two major scenarios: 
 
a. CGPA greater than or equal to 3.6 (CGPA >= 3.6) * 
Students with a CGPA greater than or equal to 3.5 at the end of First/Sophomore year are eligible for 
a direct transfer to SDSB Undergraduate Programmes (ACF/MGS), based on their given major 
preference. 
 
b. CGPA greater than or equal to 3.0 but less than 3.6 (CGPA >= 3.0 and < 3.6) ** 
Students with a CGPA greater than or equal to 3.0 but less than 3.5 can be considered for a transfer to 
SDSB Undergraduate Programmes provided the applicant meets the following two conditions: 
*a.  Students have taken at least three ACF/MGS courses by the end of First/Sophomore year. 
**b.   Student meets the criterion mentioned in (B.1) and CGPA weightage is > = 3.3. CGPA weightage1 
for such cases is calculated by giving 50% weightage to CGPA of all ACF/MGS courses and 50% 
weightage to CGPA of courses taken at other schools. 
 
If the afore-mentioned criteria (B.1) and (B.2) are fulfilled, then the student with a CGPA greater than or 
equal to 3.0 but less than 3.5 can be considered for a transfer based on the recommendation of SDSB 
Undergraduate Programme Committee and approval of the Associate Dean (Academic Programmes). 
 
Notes: 
i) 
If a student has taken less than three ACF/MGS courses by the end of the First/Sophomore year, then 
policy stated in clause (A) shall be applicable. 
ii) Students having a CGPA of less than 3.0 at the end of the First/Sophomore year are not eligible to apply 
for a transfer to SDSB Undergraduate programmes. 
iii) The policy guidelines mentioned above only serve as a screening criterion for the potential pool of 
applicants; and do not provide any guarantee for the interschool transfers to SDSB, since transfers are 
contingent upon the availability of seats and approval of the SDSB undergraduate committee. 
 
1Formula for calculation of CGPA Weightage 
[CGPA of Non ACF/MGS Courses x 0.5] + [CGPA of at least three ACF/MGS Courses x 0.5] 
 
Attendance Policy - SDSB 
 
1. Attendance Requirements: Students are expected to attend all classes scheduled for each course. 
However, up to four (4) absences can be accumulated in 3 or 4 credit hrs without a penalty. This 
requirement encompasses physical attendance in on-campus or online/hybrid classes and active 

96 
 
participation. Additionally, students must read/respond to official notifications/emails sent by the 
school's administrative offices, attend mandatory feedback sessions, and respond to invitations for 
focus groups, speaker sessions, and other scheduled activities.  
 
2. Consequences for Non-Compliance: Non-compliance with course attendance requirements will result 
in academic penalties, including grade deductions by one percent (1%) after the allowed four (4) 
absences. Once a student has eight (8) absences in a course, he/she will be given a D grade.  
 
In case of surpassing the allowed four (4) absences, the student will be notified either by the course 
faculty administrative assistant, or teaching assistant assigned to the respective course. 
 
Failure to comply with official notifications/emails, not attending mandatory feedback sessions, and 
not responding to invitations for focus groups, speaker sessions, and other scheduled activities will 
result in the blocking of Zambeel accounts and the requirement to submit a written explanation to the 
UG PCO. 
 
3. Accommodating Special Circumstances: Students facing specific challenges that may impact their 
attendance can request accommodation through the Office of Students Affairs and the Office of 
Accessibility & Inclusion following their required documentation process and will be dealt with on a 
case-to-case basis. The final decision-making authority rests with the school, based on all the 
documentary evidence and recommendations of OSA/AAA. 
 
4. Appeals Process: Students will only have the right to appeal attendance-related decisions under 
exceptional circumstances and must provide the requisite documentary evidence. The appeals process 
involves approved OSA/OAI petitions and does not exceed the maximum allowance limit of eight (8) 
absences in a course.   
 
5. Communication and Awareness: The SDSB UG Attendance Policy is to be communicated to students 
and faculty via official channels, including the university website, student handbook, and course syllabi. 
Faculty members are responsible for ensuring students are aware of the policy at the start of each 
academic semester. Every student will be responsible for keeping track of his/her attendance at any 
given point of time in the semester.

Office of Undergraduate Student Advising SDSB (OUSA - SDSB) 
 
The Office of Undergraduate Student Advising SDSB (OUSA – SDSB), aims at providing proactive, 
prescriptive, and developmental advising to the undergraduate students of SDSB from the start of their 
first year till the time they graduate. The office engages students in a developmental process that helps 
them clarify and implement individual educational plans consistent with their skills, interests, and values, 
and navigate them in achieving their personal, professional, and educational goals. Our goal is to maximize 
student retention, facilitate timely graduation and promote holistic student development. Advising nodes 
available at SDSB are PALss for first years, Faculty advisors for sophomores, while Staff academic advisors 
and Specialized faculty advisors are available for all years. These nodes are responsible for supporting all 
students either through proactive advising outreach or on student request. Below are the details regarding 
student year-wise available advisement support services. All students are encouraged to utilize all the 
available advising support and resources. Some meetings have been made mandatory for students because 
those meeting are critical for their academic success at LUMS. 
Academic Advisement for all Years:  
All students at SDSB are provided with the following advisement and support throughout their academic 
journey at LUMS:  
a. Advising Helpdesk Support: The Advising Helpdesk is available for all the undergraduate students of 
SDSB. Students can send their request to the Advising Helpdesk regarding any academic related matter 
such as semester by semester planning, enrollment related guidance, graduation tracking, major 
selection/change 
by 
or 
any 
other 
academic 
decision 
by 
emailing 
at 
undergradadvising.sdsb@lums.edu.pk Students will receive a reply from the relevant advisor with 
timely and appropriate advice or a meeting appointment. 
b. Assigned Advisors: All Students are required to meet their assigned staff academic advisor at least one 
month prior to the enrollment for the next semester to discuss semester planning and course selection. 
Graduating seniors are required to meet their advisor for validation of degree requirements. The 
details of assigned advisors are available on Zambeel student services center under the section 
‘Programme Advisor’. Students can request for an appointment with their academic advisor by sending 
an email to the advising helpdesk at undergradadvising.sdsb@lums.edu.pk.  Students will receive a 
reply from the relevant advisor with timely and appropriate advice or a meeting appointment. 
c. Faculty Specialist Referrals: Specialized advising support is available for all students on request basis. 
Students can send in their request through helpdesk (email undergradadvising.sdsb@lums.edu.pk)  
related to specialized topics on both majors (ACF or MGS) and advising office will make sure to connect 
the student with the relevant faculty for specialized guidance. The specialized topics include but are 
not limited to career development and graduate school advising. The list of specialized topics is 
available on the advising website resources section (http://sdsbadvising.lums.edu.pk) and is also 
shared with students at the start of each semester through email.

d. Workshops and Group Sessions: Workshops and group sessions are organized for targeted years. The 
workshops are based on major and minor selection, internships and research options, career 
development and post LUMS pathways, social integration, and various other topics. The details of the 
upcoming workshops / sessions are announced to the students through email. 
e. SDSB Advising Website: Advising website (http://sdsbadvising.lums.edu.pk) provides all the updated 
information regarding academic timeline, important advising deadlines, upcoming events, helpful 
advising 
resources, 
and 
FAQs. 
A 
range 
of 
resources 
are 
also 
available 
at 
http://portal.lums.edu.pk/advising (including handouts for major exploration, career planning, and 
more). 
 
Academic Advisement for Specific Student Populations:  
a. Advising Support for First Year: Peer Ambassadors at LUMS for social support (PALss) are available for 
all first-year students. Our PALss are students from junior or senior year at SDSB and undergo a rigorous 
selection and training process. From orientation week till end of first year, PALss are readily available 
to provide first year students with holistic social support that can help them to transition into LUMS 
and feel welcomed.  First year students are required to meet their assigned PALss on a mandatory basis 
(4 meetings per semester). Students can request for meeting appointments by emailing their assigned 
PALss. For general academic concerns students can also have a conversation within their PALss Online 
Support Group. 
b. Advising Support for Sophomores: Once sophomores at SDSB have declared their major, they are 
assigned a faculty advisor till the end of sophomore year. Sophomores are required to attend one 
mandatory group meeting in Fall, and two mandatory individual meetings in Fall and Spring semesters 
with their assigned faculty advisor. The sophomore faculty advising programme at SDSB has been 
established with a goal of helping each sophomore benefit from the expertise that only faculty can 
provide on specialized topics related to academia as well as professional career guidance which is vital 
at this stage as the students start navigating their major journey at LUMS. 
c. Advising Support for Juniors and Seniors:  
Academic Advisors and Faculty Advisors: Advisement support is available for the remaining two years 
on a need basis. We have 2 layers of advising support available which includes Academic Advisors and 
Specialized Faculty Advisors. Students can always reach out to the Staff Academic Advisors with any 
query or concern related to academic decision making such as major change, planning for exchange 
semester, internship and research options, career development and post LUMS pathways such as 
graduate school applications, or any other concern related to graduation tracking by sending an email 
at undergradadvising.sdsb@lums.edu.pk. Students can also reach out to the academic advisors during 
the walk-in office hours to discuss their academic concerns and to update their performance. 
Graduation Audit: All seniors must verify their degree requirements before the start of senior year with 
their academic advisor. This is important for them to ensure they have not missed any course required 
to graduate on time. 
d. Advising Support for at Risk Students: Students on warning (with a CGPA 2.50 – 2.00) and probation 
(with a CGPA below 2.00) are required to meet their academic advisor at least 2 to 4 times a semester.  
Other than that, late graduates, readmitted students, or students on semester off are also required to 
meet their academic advisor once before the start of their semester to ensure smooth graduation. 
Such students will receive mandatory meeting requests from their advisors and these students must 
meet their academic advisors on regular basis. 
e. Advising for other Students who need Additional Support: Students planning for exchange semester, 
intend to transfer outside SDSB, or those who transferred to SDSB from within or outside LUMS are 

101 
 
also required to have a mandatory meeting with their academic advisor to discuss their academic plan 
in order to ensure timely graduation. 
Pre-meeting self-reflection forms: For some meetings the school may require students to complete a 
reflection form with specific topics that are appropriate for that time in their academic career and 
programme in order to facilitate their meetings with advisors.

free elective. 
• 
SS 100A is a remedial course pre-registered in the Fall semester of first year, for students with a lower 
verbal score in their entry test (ACT, SAT, LCAT). These students are pre-registered in SS 100 in their 
Spring semester of first year.

MGSHSS School Core Curriculum 
 
The Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani School of Humanities and Social Sciences (MGSHSS) has a Core Curriculum 
for its undergraduate studies graduation requirement. The Curriculum aims to ensure that every student 
graduating from MGSHSS LUMS with a bachelor’s degree possesses a broad foundation of knowledge and 
a diverse set of transferable skills.  The interdisciplinary nature of the Core will help ensure that students 
emerge as reflective, empathetic, and historically informed individuals, with an understanding of both 
global and local current issues. 
 
Based on the LUMS philosophy regarding undergraduate education, the school has created six Thematic 
Buckets, from which students are required to take at least one course each over the duration of their 
degree.  
At least one course from each of these three first-year buckets—Arts and Humanities, Social and Behavioral 
Sciences, and STEM—must be completed by first-year students. It will take two semesters for sophomores 
to finish the Contemporary Debates bucket, which requires them to take one course from this bucket. 

104 
 
Students also must take one course from each of the buckets labeled Academic Writing and Great Authors. 
If any bucket is left unfinished, the graduation of the students may be delayed. 
Following are the buckets. 
 
 
The school provides a list of Core Curriculum courses that allows students to identify their bucket 
requirements. The identification process is called “flagging” as the thematic buckets do not carry Credit 
Hours (CHs) which means it does not require additional coursework beyond 130 CHs. 
 
Essential Check Points: 
1. Buckets must be completed in their stipulated years. 
2. ECON 100 is flagged as a Social and Behavioral Sciences course. 
3. Math 100 - Pre-calculus is flagged as a STEM course. 
4. A student needs to take a letter graded course to complete the buckets. Bucket courses cannot be 
converted to PASS/FAIL. 
5. If more than one course count towards a bucket, student can choose which one to flag. 
6. One course can fulfill a core requirement as well as your major/minor one simultaneously. But it cannot 
fill two core buckets. Each bucket must have a different course.

Programme Structure – English 
 
The BA (Honors) English program offers students individualized access to excellent teaching on Greek, 
British, American, African and World Literatures with a view to training students in methods of contextual 
reading, critical thinking and writing. One of the core objectives of the program is to engage students with 
ongoing debates about decolonizing knowledge and sensitizing them to pertinent contemporary concerns 
such as racial politics, migration, displacement, and climate change.  The program uses literary and visual 
discourse to encourage sustained engagement with issues of power, positionality, ethics and agency in 
local and transnational contexts.  
 
The program puts particular emphasis on the historical, social and political conditions surrounding literary 
production and reception. The courses draw upon a broad range of methodologies and theoretical 
approaches, such as historiography, postcolonialism, feminism, Marxism, post-structuralism, ecocriticism, 
medical humanities and affect theory to mention just a few. By honing skills in critical thinking and 
rhetorical analysis, the English major produces broadly educated and multifaceted graduates. Students are 
expected not just to grapple with the range of meanings and moments present in poetry, novels, plays, 
films, young adult fiction, creative writing and popular culture, but also to produce compelling writing of 
their own. The craft of research, scholastic writing and knowledge of the great intellectual debates on 
literary criticism are distinguishing features of the English major.  
 
Our students acquire multiple valuable skills such as effective communication, analysis, synthesis, problem-
solving, and evaluation which apply to numerous professional fields. Our graduates have pursued careers 
in civil service, journalism, digital humanities, communications, arts, teaching, counselling and 
development sector. Additionally, many of them have embarked upon higher studies in creative writing, 
social sciences and humanities doctoral programs abroad.

administered by CLCA. A student who tests out of the language requirement can take an additional 
CLCA course to make up the 52 credit hours (13) courses required for the major. 
2. For some students who have received schooling abroad, one course in Urdu from CLCA can count for 
the language requirement. In such a case, the student would take CLCA 1122 The Art of Reading and 
Writing Urdu to demonstrate study in the language.  
3. Some students may also have completed language study courses during exchange programs. For these 
students, approval of courses is required from CLCA. The course must cover standard LANG Level 1 
requirements.  
4. Because the CLCA program is focused on regional languages, students are advised to study from the 
offerings available or from related languages. In the case that a student is proficient in another 
language (for example, Korean, French, or Spanish), they must provide official evidence of this 
knowledge via a transcript or diploma, etc. 
 
Senior Project in the Humanities and Social Sciences Department 
 
The senior year project (SPROJ) is meant to give students the “opportunity to use their foundational 
academic skills and content knowledge to gain new, deeper levels of understanding.” As the student 
handbook continues, 
The project must challenge the student’s ability and the chosen topic needs to be of significant value to 
the student, the school, and the community. This directed learning experience involves thinking 
analytically, logically, and creatively integrating experience and knowledge to form reasoned judgements 
and solve problems that will help direct future career and educational opportunities. 
This guidebook is a resource of departmental procedures, standards, and best practices, which also 
includes individual streams’ policies. Individual streams have considerable autonomy in determining their 
own procedures, standards, and best practices. 
In what follows, the guidebook first lays out departmental standards and best practices; second, expected 
department-level outcomes; and third, department-level administrative procedures with which all faculty 
should be acquainted. The fourth part includes the SPROJ guidelines of each stream in the department. 
I. 
Who Can Supervise an SPROJ? 
Only full-time faculty employed by the HSS department can supervise an SPROJ or act as an examiner 
of the SPROJ. This includes full time tenure track, tenured, and non-tenure track faculty, teaching 
fellows, visiting faculty, lecturers, and teaching track faculty. 
II. Departmental Standards 
These are the standards that all streams are expected to meet. 
• 
Close, consistent, and quality supervision: Faculty should develop schedules for regular meetings 
with students (once a month, or once every two weeks, etc.) and stick to them. 
• 
Supervision limits: Faculty should supervise no more than two projects at a time. In extenuating 
circumstances, faculty may supervise three projects. 
• 
Student limits: No more than two students are allowed per project. This is irrespective of the 
stream and degree of the students. They can submit one or two papers depending on the stream’s 
preference. 
• 
Second reader: Each SPROJ should be read (i.e., examined) not only by the supervisor but also by 
another faculty member. Ideally that faculty member should be from the same stream or have 

127 
 
interests and expertise directly relevant to the discipline(s) and topics of the SPROJ. Streams should 
have a deadline by when second readers should be selected. If a second reader is not selected in 
time, then the Chair of the Department of HSS, in conjunction with the relevant stream heads, will 
appoint one.  
• 
Enrollment: Working on projects over the summer is not a substitute for enrollment in the SPROJ 
in the subsequent fall and spring terms. 
Faculty may begin working informally with students over the summer, for example, by applying for 
the Students as Co-Researchers (ScR) program. However, students must still enrol in the SPROJ in 
the fall and spring terms. 
• 
Methodology prerequisite: Each stream should clarify its methodology prerequisites for the 
students wanting to take an SPROJ, and ensure that the appropriate course(s), training, seminars, 
or workshops are offered in a timely manner.  
• 
Student Interaction: Larger streams should encourage students to meet amongst themselves a few 
times to discuss their projects and learn from their peers.  
 
III. Department Responsibilities 
 
Every academic year the Chair of the HSS Department will appoint a full-time faculty member of the 
Department to serve as the HSS Department SPROJ Coordinator for part or all of the academic year. 
The coordinator, assisted by the Department’s academic staff and in coordination with the Chair of the 
Department and the Dean’s Office, will organize the following: 
• 
Prizes 
The best SPROJ projects will receive prizes that include honoraria and a printed and bound thesis. 
• 
Physical archiving 
All SPROJs will be catalogued and archived with the assistance of the academic staff. Students will 
be required to fill out a submission form and email a final editable copy to the department according 
to the provided template. SPROJs should have an abstract page. Students may request an embargo 
on the physical availability of their SPROJ. 
• 
Spring conference 
The HSS Department SPROJ Coordinator will organize a colloquium in the Spring semester where 
SPROJ students present their projects to faculty and their fellow students. This will facilitate inter- 
and multi-disciplinary conversations, encourage students, faculty, and others to engage with 
student research, and enable greater visibility for the SPROJ in general. 
 
IV. Departmental Procedures 
The process of planning a senior project starts prior to the enrollment phases of the semester. It is 
advisable that students start planning a senior project even prior to course selection and registration. 
Following steps are followed for SPROJ registration and review. 
 
a. Email to Juniors: A email will be sent to juniors in March to start planning their SPROJ if they wish 
to it up in their senior year.  
Points from ‘b to d’ are specific to every stream. However, these general guidelines are followed 
for approval and registration of a senior project.  
b. Select a topic and the potential supervisor: Students should select a topic and supervisor before 
they plan to begin working on the project. Selecting a topic will involve three elements: choosing 

128 
 
the subject students will be working on, the approach to the subject, and the form the project will 
take. The process of selecting a topic should involve consultation with the proposed supervisor.  
c. Write a proposal: The students are required to draft a proposal before the semester in which 
students plan to complete the project.  
d. Review and Approval of the proposal: The supervisor will review the proposal and formally give 
the approval to register for the SPROJ. During this phase, the supervisor and supervisee are 
responsible to get an IRB approval before initiating research for their project if it involves human 
subjects. This IRB later should be added to the Appendix.  
e. Registration for Directed Course Work (SPROJ, Independent Study and Directed Research 
Project) on Zambeel: The RO announces registration before the commencement of enrollment 
phase I & II. Once the applications are approved by the coordinator they are forwarded to 
supervising faculty, which they can approve via their Zambeel self-service.  
f. 
Enrollment: After Zambeel approvals, the students are also required to enroll in SPROJ during the 
enrollment phases.  
g. Data Collation: After Zambeel approvals, the program coordinators collate the SPROJ students’ 
data and send it to their respective SPROJ faculty coordinators. At this point program coordinator 
will send an email with title page template and style guidelines. 
h. Grading: It is responsibility of the supervisor to enter SPROJ grade on Zambeel within the grading 
deadline. 
i. 
SPROJ Prize and Archiving: The final copy (fully formatted with title page included) of an SPROJ is 
shared with the department for archiving and final evaluation for an SPROJ Prize/Award. Each 
stream head will form a committee to evaluate SPROJs for best SPROJ prize. SPROJ prize will be 
awarded on convocation. 
 
V. Programme-Specific Guidelines 
 
Anthropology/Sociology 
1. SPROJ in ANTH-SOC is two semesters long and is worth 8 credit hours. Students are required to apply 
via Zambeel for SPROJ 1 in Fall and SPROJ 2 in Spring.   
2. Students opting for an SPROJ in Anthropology or Sociology can partner with only one other student. 
Groups of 3 or more people cannot do an SPROJ together.  
3. To register for an SPROJ, a student must have a CGPA of 3.2. Exceptions can be made if the supervisor 
and the SPROJ coordinator approves.   
4. The student applying for SPROJ in Anthropology and Sociology should have taken one of the following 
research methods courses; ANTH320 – Qualitative Research Methods or SOC320 – Quantitative 
Research Methods. Exceptions can be made if the student enrolls in a Research Methods course along 
with SPROJ enrollment. This requires approval from the SPROJ Coordinator and the supervisor.  
5. Students are advised to contact potential supervisors before enrolling and discuss projects with them 
over the course of the summer.   
6. The students are required to right an SPROJ proposal (1-2 pages long) highlighting proposed project 
and methodology. The title of the proposed project should be approved by the supervisor before 
applying on Zambeel.  
7. SPROJ proposal colloquium is organized in late Fall semester and the final colloquium is held in Spring 
semester.   
8. The first part of the SPROJ is graded as in-progress (I) on Zambeel and the final project is graded by the 
supervisor with a letter grade on Zambeel during grading phase of the Spring semester. 
 

129 
 
Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies (CLCA) 
 
1. CLCA students opting to undertake a senior project should ideally have a sense of their project and 
their supervisor (a faculty member in CLCA) by the spring of their junior year. 
2. After conferring with one of the respective faculty members, students will be able to decide on a 
supervisor and begin work on their project.  
3. Students are required to complete the CLCA Senior Project Proposal form by the beginning of the 
fall semester of their senior year that details their project and the expected timelines () agreed 
upon between the student and their supervisor.  
4. CLCA senior projects can focus on one of the following sub-fields of the discipline: Literary Studies, 
Comparative Literature, Persian Literature, Translation, Creative Writing, Filmmaking Screen 
Studies, Visual and Digital Storytelling, and other relevant areas in Literature and the Arts.  Details 
and requirements for projects in these sub-fields and relevant supervisors should be discussed 
with the CLCA faculty.  
5. CLCA senior projects can be both scholarly (critical essay, film criticism etc.) and creative (short 
narrative or documentary film, novella, graphic novel, poetry, translations etc). Creative work must 
be accompanied by a short introduction or rationale for the project and its methodology and other 
documentation required by the supervisor 
6. CLCA projects must grapple with the questions central to the programme and employ at least one 
non-English language. 
7. Students may also be asked to participate in a small colloquium in the Spring semester of their 
senior year in which they share their work with faculty and peers and/or a defence of their project.  
   
English 
1. The minimum CGPA requirement is 3.00  
2. A one-page proposal to be submitted by mid-July. The proposal should have the following information:   
• Tentative titles (two or three)   
• Preferred supervisor’s name  
• An abstract with thesis  
• Textual sources and 3-4 secondary sources   
3. Further guidelines for the SPROJ breakdown and weightage:  
• Introduction and Chapter 1 to be submitted by the end of Fall Semester - 25%   
• Mid-term colloquium due at the end of Fall semester - 5%  
• Meetings with SPROJ Coordinator - 15%  
• Remaining chapters (submission date decided by the supervisor) - 45%   
• Final colloquium at the end of Spring Semester - 10% 
  
If you are working in the English Literature stream you must have taken at least two courses with your 
supervisor. 
History 
1. Students must speak to the coordinator before the proposal is officially approved.  
2. Over the course of the academic year, the SPROJ Coordinator will run several workshops or colloquia 
that the students are required to attend.  
3. In the case that your supervisor is not part of one of the major-granting streams (Anthro/Socio, History, 
Literature in English, or Political Sciences), you must decide which field your project lies closest to and 
attend all Senior Project related activities run by the respective coordinator.  

130 
 
4. The final draft of the project will be graded by the faculty member advising the project, as well as by 
the second reader.  
5. Faculty members are usually advised not to take on more than three Senior Projects per academic 
year. They may elect to take on fewer than three projects as well. Therefore, if you are interested in 
working with a particular advisor, please contact them sooner rather than later. 
 
Political Science 
1. Students are required to have a minimum SGPA of 3.0 in order to do the Senior Project in Political 
Science. Under exceptional circumstances, supervisors have the discretion to waive this requirement.  
2. Students should have successfully completed the Qualitative Research Methods or where appropriate, 
Quantitative Analysis course before they start their senior project. All those students who have taken 
ECON 330 Econometrics or ANTH 320 Introduction to Qualitative Research Methods are not required 
to take POL 228 for the SPROJ enrollment.   
3. The application process for the senior project requires the submission of a ONE-page proposal to 
stream SPROJ Coordinator at the end of the Spring term prior to the enrollment in the Senior Project. 
Students may consult and name a potential faculty supervisor. The proposal needs to outline a 
tentative title, aims and objectives, potential research question and methodology. The stream faculty 
will meet and decide what project is most suitable for which faculty members. 
4. Two students may be allowed to do a joint project, but they must justify the need of a partner in terms 
of the project workload and this need to be demonstrated in the proposal. Only the instructor will 
allow the students to make a group where they seem that projects of two students overlap with one 
another.   
5. Students must enroll for the senior project in the Fall and Spring semesters.  
6. Students are expected to work on their projects over the summer, but this cannot be a substitute for 
the Fall or Spring semester. 
7. The following rules are observed for grading of SPROJ in Political Science. 
• 20% of the grade is based on presentations and participation in seminars and colloquiums.  
• Supervisors have the discretion to break down the remaining 80% as they see fit. However, students 
who miss seminars and/or colloquiums are penalized 10% of their grade for each absence. 
• The final paper component of the grade will be an average of the supervisor and second grader’s 
grade. 
• Students can select their second grader in consultation with their supervisor.   
 
SPROJ in Minors: 
1. These guidelines are specifically for SPROJ taken in the following minors: 
• Gender and Sexuality Studies  
• Philosophy  
• Psychology   
• Study of Religion  
• Environmental Studies  
2. Senior Projects taken in the aforementioned areas will have minor specific codes rather the generic SS 
codes.  
3. Only students pursuing the minor can sign up for a Senior Project in GSS, REL, PSY, PHIL, or ENV. In 
order to demonstrate this, the student must have taken 4 courses in the minor by the end of their 
Junior year.  
4. In the event that a student is not minoring, the Senior Project course code will be in their major.  

131 
 
5. Students are advised not to pursue a Senior Project in these minors without have taken 4 courses in 
the minor by their Junior Spring. 
6. The Senior Project does not count as part of the six courses required for the minor.

governments and citizens. The economics major equips students with rigorous quantitative tools that allow 
them to understand the domestic and global economic environment and analyze its impact. The BSc. 
(Honours) Economics major is a quantitatively oriented programme that provides excellent preparation for 
graduate studies and careers in economics, business administration, non-government organizations, 
academia and the corporate sector.

Programme Structure - Politics and Economics (Joint Major) 
 
The Politics and Economics (P&E) Joint Major provides a strong base to those who intend to have 
knowledge of the political economy. The P&E programme is a carefully constructed major that provides 
students the opportunity to study two disciplines, as well as areas that cut across traditional departmental 
and disciplinary lines. Through courses developed and taught by Economics and Political Science faculty, 
students examine the globalizing world using a variety of conceptual lenses supplied by the social sciences, 
learn multiple ways of solving problems, and explore areas of inquiry that intersect traditional disciplines. 
The courses in Politics help students understand the dynamics of political systems, how they affect 
international relations and how they support a nation, thus realizing their responsibility to the society and 
the country. The study of Economics prepares students to take part in governmental policy making and 
changes in economic systems. Economic study not only impacts the individuals but also contribute to the 
society at large. 
 
Graduation Requirements: 
Kindly refer to Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 for the complete Politics and Economics programme structure, 
totaling 130 Credit Hours. Each semester a new course memo is shared with the students by the Registrar’s 
Office. The students must consult the course memo before planning their courses for completion of the 
requirements.

MGSHSS Undergraduate Academic Advising Unit 
 
The Academic Advising Unit (AAU) at MGSHSS aims to promote positive outcomes in MGSHSS students by 
supporting them through their journey at LUMS. The goal of the unit is to ensure that all MGSHSS students, 
and particularly the most vulnerable, are able to access quality academic and pastoral advice. The advising 
unit incorporates three major nodes: faculty, students and administrators who give both academic and 
non-academic guidance throughout the four years. This guidance includes advice on academic goals such 
as degree planning, extra-curriculars, settling into college life, professional development and educational 
progression. To benefit from this guidance, students are expected to reach out to the unit in a timely 
manner and have regular meetings with relevant advisors. 
 
Academic Advisement for all Years:  
All students in MGSHSS will have the following support available for all years:   
a) The Staff Academic Advisors at the Academic Advising Unit (AAU):  The Staff Academic Advisors at

Academic Advisement for Specific Student Population: 
 
A. First years and Sophomores (Undeclared): 
 
a. Peer Ambassadors at LUMS for Social Support (PALss): They are Junior and Senior year MGSHSS 
students. PALss will be assigned at the start of students’ first year at LUMS and will remain in contact 
with students till the end of sophomore year. Students will be offered a mix of mandatory and 
voluntary meetings with the PALss and will be informed about these via email. PALss will work closely 
with advising staff to provide peer-to-peer advice. Their main role is to check-in with their mentees 
and make sure they are aware of all resources at LUMS that can help students acclimatize with 
university life.  
b. Staff Academic Advisors: Students will have Mandatory one-on-one sessions with detailed agendas 
to discuss progress in the first two years.  Students will be informed about mandatory meetings in 
advance via email. Academic Advisors will also be available for drop-in office hours. Students are 
expected to attend all mandatory meetings and try to voluntarily show up in office hours to discuss 
progress at LUMS. Staff Academic Advisors can address any kind of queries related to their academic 
management, enrollment, and major selection/change issues. Students can drop an email at the 
school’s official advising email address (see below).  
c. Faculty Representatives: Undeclared students can reach out to designated faculty members for 
pastoral care. These faculty members will hold group advising sessions and office hours for students 
as well. 
 
B. Juniors and Seniors:  
a. Faculty Advisors: They will be assigned to students once they select and enter their majors and 
comprise faculty from their chosen majors. Faculty advisors act as field experts to guide their 
advisees on topics such as: identifying educational goals, connecting academic choices to intellectual 
passions, time management, studying strategies, reading strategies, academic integrity, and 
development of skills and attitudes that will lead to success. Faculty Advisors will offer two 
mandatory meetings for juniors and one voluntary meeting for seniors. Apart from these mandatory 
meetings, students are encouraged to set up appointments and discuss their academic progress, 
work planning charts and any issues related to social adjustment. Students who miss mandatory 
meetings in a semester will not be allowed to enroll in the following semester. This will be reflected 
in a block placed on the enrollment feature on their Zambeel account. 
b. Department Coordinators: They will oversee degree requirements (university requirements, 
major/minor requirements, and outgroups) for students. Students that are off-track will have 
mandatory sessions with department coordinators if needed. It is encouraged that Juniors and 
Seniors should take all queries related to enrollment and degree completion to department 
coordinators ideally prior to enrollment cycle. 
c. Graduating Seniors: At this stage, students can reach out to department coordinators if they have 
queries related to degree completion. If they have questions regarding careers and graduate school, 
or want to be referred to any faculty they can email at undergradadvising.mgshss@lums.edu.pk  
d. Support for students on probation and on academic warning: Students on probation and academic 
warning (please see section on Academic Standing) will have regular check-in with a dedicated 
Academic Advisor assigned to them. They will be contacted via email to book appointments. It is 
mandatory for students facing academic difficulties to meet regularly with the advisor. 
 

153 
 
Staff Advisor Details and Meetings: Students can book meetings with Staff Academic Advisors by 
emailing at undergradadvising.mghss@lums.edu.pk. It is considered best practice to contact/meet with 
the allocated advisor at least five times during a year.

Elective must be outside a student’s major area of study but within SBASSE. It must be a 200+ level course. 
For EE Majors PHY-204: Electricity and Magnetism will count towards their SBASSE Elective. 
For CS and CHE Majors: (MATH 102) Calculus II will count towards their SBASSE Elective. 
**Students who wish to pursue Economics & Mathematics (Joint Major), will have to take additional 08 
credits in SBASSE Core.

Major Elective Requirements 
Students pursuing different majors must enroll in elective courses offered by their department. The list of 
electives offered is fluid and can vary from one semester to another. Students may choose to follow a 
“stream” if offered by a particular department. Students must take a minimum of 9 credit hours from this 
category of courses; the maximum number of credit hours obtained from major elective courses varies 
depending on the discipline as follows: 
 
Biology 
 
 
09 Credit hours 
Chemistry

Free Electives 
In addition to the major core and major elective courses, students must enroll in courses categorized as 
“free electives”. The free electives may be “scattered” LUMS-wide or may be “concentrated” and used 
towards obtaining any one of the minor degrees offered by MGSHSS, SBASSE or SDSB. The total number of 
credit hours obtained from courses that are in the “free elective” category vary depending on the discipline 
as follows: 
 
Biology

Double Major Policy for SBASSE Students 
After having declared a major, student may opt for a second major (space and fulfilment of other 
requirements permitting) no later than the start of sixth semester at LUMS, after due consultation with 
their faculty advisors. Completion of requirements of both majors does not automatically allow a student 
to claim a double major degree without declaring it beforehand in a timely manner. 
 
Students need to fulfil the following requirements for a double major: 
• 
Requirements of national and international accreditation bodies should be accounted for both majors 
in double major. Any course or credit-hours requirements and degree title should not contradict the 
official rules outlined by the respective accreditation body for that degree. 
• 
For majors in SBASSE, the major selection requirements specified in the student handbook should be 
met.  
• 
Successful completion of minimum 160 credit hours. 
• 
Successful completion of SBASSE School Core requirements including courses and labs. 
• 
A request for double major must be accepted by both the departments (majors). 
• 
Students pursuing a double major need to complete the University core and University 
distribution requirements according to the primary declared major. 
• 
The students are required to complete the core and elective requirements of both majors. This includes 
completion of major core and elective and school core and elective. In case of 
overlap in core and elective requirements (cross-listed courses) double counting is permitted. 
• 
Minimum CGPA requirement for declaration of double major should be 3.00 and above. The students 
are required to maintain a minimum CGPA of 2.50 throughout the programme tenure. 
• 
The maximum allowed time to complete the requirements of double major is six years from the year 
of admission at LUMS. 
• 
If a student who is aspiring for double majors applies after the deadline has passed but is able to satisfy 
the primary and secondary department’s double major coursework requirements along with a 
workable future course plan, an exception may be evaluated by the primary and secondary 
departments. 
• 
The aforementioned policy applies to both inbound/outbound students at SBASSE. 
• 
Students wishing to pursue a double major need to fill the double major declaration form available at 
the Office of the Registrar portal: http://portal.lums.edu.pk/RegistrarOffice.

*Credit Hours taken towards free electives will vary according to the number of credit hours taken for the University Distribution (Out group).  
**The SBASSE Elective requirement is one course of 3 credits to be taken outside the major, but within SBASSE, in Sophomore year or beyond. 
***Mathematics core courses are being offered in two variants, namely, general and honours (H), e.g. Math 101 and Math 101H are, 
respectively, the general and honours variants of the course Calculus I. The honours variant is an advanced and more challenging version of the 
general variant, however, both variants will equivalently serve as core requirements for major selection and degree completion. Students will be 
able to choose between the two variants based on their need and/or interest.

*Credit Hours taken towards free electives will vary according to the number of credit hours taken for the University Distribution (Out group).  
**The SBASSE Elective requirement is one course of 3 credits to be taken outside the major, but within SBASSE, in Sophomore year or beyond. 
*** Mathematics core courses are being offered in two variants, namely, general and honours (H), e.g. Math 101 and Math 101H are, 
respectively, the general and honours variants of the course Calculus I. The honours variant is an advanced and more challenging version of 
the general variant, however, both variants will equivalently serve as core requirements for major selection and degree completion. Students 
will be able to choose between the two variants based on their need and/or interest.

# Freshman students intending to declare computer science as their major are strongly advised to enroll in the CS200 (Introduction to 
Programming) course during their spring semester 
*Credit Hours taken towards free electives will vary according to the number of credit hours taken for the University Distribution (Out group).  
**The SBASSE Elective requirement for CS majors is fulfilled by (MATH 102) Calculus II. 
***CS 471 and CS 473 satisfy the requirement to take CS 382. 
****Mathematics core courses are being offered in two variants, namely, general and honours (H), e.g. Math 101 and Math 101H are, respectively, 
the general and honours variants of the course Calculus I. The honours variant is an advanced and more challenging version of the general variant, 
however, both variants will equivalently serve as core requirements for major selection and degree completion. Students will be able to choose 
between the two variants based on their need and/or interest.

*Credit Hours taken towards free electives will vary according to the number of credit hours taken for the University Distribution (Out group).  
**The SBASSE Elective requirement for BS Math majors is one course of 3 credits to be taken outside the major, but within SBASSE, in 
Sophomore year or beyond. For BSc Math majors, however, this requirement can be satisfied by taking any free elective of 3 credits. 
***Mathematics core courses are being offered in two variants, namely, general and honours (H), e.g. Math 101 and Math 101H are, 
respectively, the general and honours variants of the course Calculus I. The honours variant is an advanced and more challenging version of 
the general variant, however, both variants will equivalently serve as core requirements for major selection and degree completion. Students 
will be able to choose between the two variants based on their need and/or interest.

The Economics and Mathematics (Joint Major) Programme 
 
The Economics and Mathematics joint major provides a strong base to those students who intend to pursue 
further studies at the graduate level in the field of Economics. Students seeking admission to a graduate 
programme have a higher chance of getting admitted to top ranked schools if they have taken mathematics 
courses like calculus, analysis, and linear algebra during their undergraduate degree programme. 
 
A joint major housed at both Schools. 
The major will now also be housed at Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering (SBASSE), in addition 
to the currently offered programme BSc Economics and Mathematics by Mushtaq Ahmed Gurmani School 
of Humanities and Social Sciences (MGSHSS). Students graduate with a BS or BSc (Hons) degree 
respectively. The major requirements, major cores and electives are identical across both schools; 
however, school requirements differ. 
 
Students pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Economics and Mathematics must complete the university core and 
distribution in addition to the major core, elective and free elective requirements, while those pursuing a 
BS in Economics and Mathematics from the SBASSE must additionally complete the SBASSE school core 
requirements. The SBASSE sophomore students can opt for a major change whereas students from the rest 
of the schools can apply for an inter school transfer. 
 
For the award of specialization Medal at the time of graduation, students of both schools are in competition 
for the major in Economics & Mathematics (joint major) Gold Medal. 
 
For further details, please refer to Policy ‘Medals: Specialization – Major’ under Section I. 
 
Entry Requirement for Economics and Mathematics Joint Major:  
A student wishing to major in Economics and Mathematics must have the following at the time of applying 
for this major: 
1. A CGPA of 3.3 or above. 
2. A minimum of B in Calculus-I and Linear Algebra with Differential Equations. 
 
The maximum number of students accepted into this major each year is 50 (inclusive of both schools). 
 
Graduation Requirements: 130 credit hours 
Kindly refer to the Undergraduate Programme Policies and Regulations  
 
University Core: 9 credit hours 
Kindly refer to the Undergraduate Programme Policies and Regulations. 
 
Students enrolled in the BS programme must complete the SSE Core (34 credit hours) and take 3 out-group 
courses as part of their University Distribution. In-group requirements are taken care of by the SSE Core. 
Kindly refer to the Undergraduate Programme Policies and Regulations.

Economics Elective Courses; 8 Credit hours (2 courses) 
Two or more courses with an ECON code are required beyond those listed as core Economics courses. Of 
these, at least one must be at the 400 level (Senior requirement). The Senior requirement cannot be 
fulfilled by the 400-level course taken as part of the core or by a Senior Project or Independent Study. 
 
Note: Transfer students or the students who go on an exchange programme and fall short by 1 or 2 credits in 
their economics core or elective courses are allowed to take 1 or 2 credit Independent Study to fulfil graduation 
requirements. 
 
Suggested Economics Elective Courses: 
It is recommended that students in the Economics and Mathematics major who wish to go on to graduate 
programmes in economics, consider the following courses for their economics elective courses:

SBASSE Minors 
In the beginning of Fall 2012, the SBASSE introduced minors in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, 
Mathematics, and Physics. MGSHSS and SDSB students keen to diversify their undergraduate experience 
in the sciences or SBASSE students wanting to complement their major discipline with another closely 
related area are encouraged to take full advantage of this new initiative. The minor degree is intended to 
impart fundamental knowledge in a specific area but carries with it limited depth and breadth. To satisfy 
degree requirements for a minor, students must accumulate a minimum of 18 credit hours by taking 6 
courses in their area of interest and secure a cumulative GPA of 2.75 in them. Please refer to Section 1: 
Undergraduate Programme Polices and Regulation (Policy 19.1)

must be adhered to by students who are interested in obtaining a minor in SBASSE. Courses which are part 
of major core in an area will not count towards their minor; students must therefore take additional courses 
in an area, prescribed by a department to fulfil their minor degree requirements. 
 
SBASSE departments offering a minor have provided a menu of compulsory courses, from which a certain 
number must be taken, to qualify for the minor degree. SBASSE students choosing any of the compulsory 
courses as “SBASSE elective” must take another course from the list, since one course cannot be used 
simultaneously towards a minor as well as to satisfy SBASSE elective requirement. Additionally, students 
must take two 300 level courses from the list of elective courses provided by each discipline. 
List of courses that can be taken to obtain a minor in each of the five areas at SBASSE is given. 
 
Biology Minor 
 
To obtain a minor in Biology, students must take a minimum of 6 regular courses (18 to 24 credit hours). 
Students should note that the SBASSE elective will not double count towards both Biology minor and the 
SBASSE elective requirement. 
 
Compulsory Courses 
From the list of compulsory courses, a student must take at least two courses in addition to BIO 101 and 
BIO 216 (both deemed as minor “core” courses). SBASSE students choosing any of the compulsory courses 
as SBASSE elective must take an additional course from the list of compulsory courses. Students should 
note that the SBASSE elective will not double count towards both Biology minor and SBASSE elective.

SBASSE students (non-EE) would therefore have to take one additional Physics course at 200+ level to 
complete the minor credit hour requirements. 
 
**Electricity and Magnetism will not count towards the minor requirements of EE major students who take 
it as part of EE major core. EE students would need to take two additional Physics courses at 200+ level to 
complete the minor credit hour requirements. 
 
Optional Courses 
Students must take any two 300+ level Physics courses. 
Robotics Minor 
The Electrical Engineering Department has launched an undergraduate minor in the field of Robotics. 
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that builds on several core engineering and science disciplines such as 
Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics. A robotic 
system typically involves environment perception, information processing & intelligent decision making, 
and physical actuation for accomplishing any assigned task. To design such a system, a robotics engineer 
needs a strong command on a diverse set of topics including kinematics, dynamics and control, signal 
processing, optimal planning, sensing systems, embedded systems, and intelligent decision systems. 
The minor in robotics is a flexible program that brings up to speed students from all across LUMS and 
launches them into the exciting area. Through a minimalist but rigorous stream of courses navigating 
through electronics, programming, control, systems, learning, artificial intelligence, and dynamics; 
students can now access a new world that is surely and imminently upon us.

Academic Advising at SBASSE 
The SBASSE Undergraduate Student Academic Affairs Office helps students in planning their academic 
career during their undergraduate degree programme from the start of freshman year to graduation. The 
office helps the students clarify and implement individual educational plans that match their skills, 
interests, and values, and guides them to achieve their personal, professional and educational goals. This 
advising can be about course planning and enrolment, major selection, maintaining good academic 
standing, extracurricular activities, career guidance or any other issues that require counselling. At SBASSE, 
students are provided with the necessary academic advising through a faculty advisor, staff advisors in the 
Dean’s Academic Affairs Office and more. All students are encouraged to utilize all the available advising 
support and resources. Some meetings have been made mandatory for students because those meetings 
are critical for their academic success at LUMS. Our goal is to enable a timely graduation and encourage 
the student's comprehensive development. 
Advising Support for all Students: 
a) Staff Advisors will guide you about the enrolment processes, course plan and other advising nodes on 
the 
day 
of 
orientation. 
All 
the 
queries 
from 
students 
can 
be 
addressed 
at 
undergradadvising.sbasse@lums.edu.pk. The queries will be answered via emails or in-person 
meetings with the staff advisors will be arranged if necessary.  
b) Faculty advisors are an integral part of the advising system at SBASSE as they provide invaluable 
support to help the students adjust to the academic space of the school. Faculty advisors help students 
navigate their way through the academic streams at SBASSE, by providing guidance related to 
academic domains such as course selection, major declaration, and academic performance. Students 
can also discuss non-academic concerns with their faculty advisors, such as social integration issues. 
Students can access information about their faculty advisor using their Zambeel accounts.  
c) Workshops:  Advisement sessions will be arranged for students during the year. These sessions will 
address all academic/non-academic issues. A school-wide event known as the ‘Major Day’ will be 
arranged for the firs-year students towards the end of their first-year to help them select their major.  

195 
 
d) Online Resources: A range of support resources are available at http://portal.lums.edu.pk/advising 
(including handouts for major exploration, career planning, and more).  
 
Advising Support for Specific Students:  
 
I) First-years:  
 
• 
Faculty Advisor: In their first year at SBASSE, students are assigned a specific faculty member as an 
advisor. First-year students have one mandatory meeting with their faculty advisor in the Fall semester 
and one optional meeting in the Spring semester; however, students are encouraged to reach out to 
their respective advisors as many times as they want, to fulfil their advising needs. First-year students 
are encouraged to seek guidance related to major selection, which is an important milestone of their 
first year at SBASSE.  
• 
Peer Ambassador at LUMS for Social Support (PALss): In the first year, PALss will also be assigned to 
the students. They are selective junior and senior students who will be there to guide first-years about 
the available resources of the university, help them get accustomed to the LUMS and SBASSE 
environment and be available for students if they are facing any non-academic issues. PALs will not be 
dispensing any academic advice to first-year students, but they can guide them to relevant academic 
advising resources. Students will have three informal meetings with their PALs throughout the 
semester to help them integrate into the LUMS environment. 
 
 II) Sophomores: 
Once the students move to their sophomore year and have declared their major, they would then be 
reassigned a faculty advisor in their major for the remainder of their programme at SBASSE. Students are 
encouraged to seek the support of their major-specific faculty advisor for addressing any issues related to 
their chosen major. Sophomores have two mandatory meetings with their faculty advisor throughout the 
academic year, with one in each semester.  
III) Juniors/Seniors: 
Junior year students have one optional meeting with their faculty advisor in Fall and one mandatory 
meeting in Spring. Additionally, the students in their senior year have one optional meeting with their 
faculty advisor in Fall and no mandatory meetings. Students are encouraged to meet with their advisors, 
in addition to these meetings, to make the most of their academic journey at SBASSE.  
IV) At-risk Students: 
Students facing probation during any given semester (students with a CGPA below 2.00) have a mandatory 
check-in with staff advisors to discuss their academic performance and receive any additional support.  
 
Pre-meeting self-reflection forms: For some meetings the school may require students to complete a 
reflection form with specific topics that are appropriate for that time in their academic career and 
programme in order to facilitate their meetings with advisors.  
 
 
Staff Advisors in the Dean’s Academic Affairs Team:  
Staff advisors provide invaluable support to students for any kind of academic/non-academic management 
issues that they might face during their time at LUMS. They are available for:  
• 
Guidance related to the enrolment process, core completion, workload management and referrals.  

196 
 
• 
One-on-one meetings to provide individualized support related to any academic/non-academic 
domains (by appointment or through walk-in meetings)  
• 
Assisting students in getting more information about on-campus support services and resources. 
• 
Connecting students with relevant departments/offices to address their concerns in a timely way. 
• 
Providing support related to important university processes, considerable milestones, and guidelines 
to fulfil graduation requirements in due course of time.  
 
Students can reach out to the staff advisors if they require any help in understanding the school’s policies 
and procedures. For queries related to the above topics/services or for any other queries, you can drop an 
email at the school’s official advising email address.

SHAIKH AHMAD HASSAN SCHOOL OF LAW (SAHSOL) 
 
The Shaikh Ahmad Hassan School of Law (SAHSOL) B.A.-LL.B. (Honours) is a five-year, full-times 
programme. It consists of a two-year B.A. phase followed by the LL.B. degree, which is accredited by the 
Pakistan Bar Council as a qualifying law degree. The combination of a B.A and an LL.B. in one programme 
offers our students a solid grounding in the humanities and sciences followed by thorough professional 
training in law. 
 
The B.A. phase prepares students for the study of law, introducing them to a range of relevant subjects 
from a variety of disciplines offered by the other four schools of LUMS. Students may study economics, 
political science, psychology, anthropology/sociology, education, finance, or the hard sciences. The three-
year LL.B. phase consists of mandatory law courses, such as Criminal, Contract and Public Law, and a variety 
of elective law courses in specialized areas, such as taxation, arbitration, intellectual property law and 
competition law. Electives are generally offered in five streams: Public Law, International and Comparative 
Law, Legal Theory, Criminal Law and Business Law.  
 
At SAHSOL, classes are taught through a combination of lectures, Socratic pedagogy, seminars, and clinical 
or experiential learning. Students are assessed by a mixture of graded instruments: examinations, quizzes, 
presentations, simulations, and written assessments. 
 
The School of Law prides itself on an interactive teaching environment. A low student-to-faculty ratio 
ensures that students receive personalized attention from members of the faculty. 
 
BA-LL.B. (Honours) Programme

* Introduction to Pakistan Legal System and Introduction to Legal Reasoning may also be completed in the Sophomore year.

Sequence of LLB Courses 
Students must follow the sequence of LLB courses set out in the five-year BA-LL.B. (Honours) plan. Students 
who stray from this sequence do so at their own risk: the Law School will not accommodate requests for 
changes in the timetable by individual students who have missed compulsory LLB courses and are therefore 
not able to complete the programme within five years. 
 
Leave of Absence 
Although students who take a semester-long leave of absence during their LLB degree are allowed to 
resume their LLB studies the following semester after approval from the Head of Department or Dean, this 
is not recommended. LLB courses build upon one another, and not studying the courses in sequence will 
place you at a disadvantage. Therefore, students who are forced to forego a semester are advised to wait 
an entire academic year (Two semesters) before rejoining the LL.B. programme.  
 
It is very likely that students who take a leave of absence for one semester will have to add on an extra 
semester to their degree in order to complete the missed LLB courses; and students who take the entire 
year off will have their graduation delayed by a whole year.

Directed Course Work (DCW) 
Students are encouraged to participate in scholarly research and writing project (Directed Course Work 
“DCW”) in the penultimate or final year of their degree. DCW may take the form of an Independent Study, 
a Directed Research Project (DRP) or a Senior Project (SPROJ). Please note that students are only allowed 
to undertake one SPROJ during their degree programme, be it a single 4 credit hour SPROJ or a combined 
8 credit hour SPROJ. Students cannot take two separate 4 credit hour SPROJs and are restricted to a 
maximum of 12 credit hours of DCW during the course of their degree. 
 
Both the Independent Study and the DRP span over a single semester, consist of 4000-5000 words 
(including footnotes), and amount to 1-2 credit hours. They are both graded Pass/Fail. However, the 
Independent Study must be undertaken alone whereas the DRP may be undertaken by a group. The SPROJ 
may span over one semester or two, depending on the number of credit hours, which can vary from 3-8, 
and consists of 8000-10,000 words (including footnotes). The SPROJ can be undertaken by an individual or 
group of students. The SPROJ is assigned a letter grade. 
 
Although not compulsory, DCW is a valuable opportunity to engage in original research and to prepare a 
substantial written piece of work, which will enable you to develop transferable skills that are useful in 
your law career. Most students find that DCW is one of the most rewarding parts of their degree 
programme. DCW may count as part of the Major Electives or Free Electives. 
 
DCW is predominantly independent work, and each student or group of students is assigned a supervisor 
to assist them in this process. Please note that the role of the supervisor is not to teach you the topic you 
have chosen to research, but to help shape your ideas and to give you advice on how to conduct research. 
Your supervisor will expect you to be organized, self-disciplined and motivated enough to take 
responsibility for your own work and complete it by agreed deadlines. 
 
The DCW topic is subject to the approval of the supervisor, who may be any member of the Law School 
Faculty (permanent or adjunct) under whose direction you wish to write the Independent 
Study/DRP/SPROJ. The following is a suggestive, but by no means exhaustive, list of potential research 
topics: 
• 
An original Research Project using, for example, a set of case law on a particular legal issue. 
• 
An original research question about a particular legal theory and its critique based on scholarly material 
or real-world application e.g., use of Hans Kelsen’s Pure Theory of Law for the justification of Martial 
Laws in Pakistan. 
• 
A critical review of the scholarly literature on some aspect of the student’s major field e.g., legal reform 
discourse on gender equality in Pakistan. 
• 
An analysis of a particular statute or provision of law based on legal commentaries, case law and facts 
e.g., Section 4 of the Muslim Family Law Ordinance 1961 relating to the share of orphaned 
grandchildren in inheritance. 
 

202 
 
Planning and Conducting DCW 
Important stages in the DCW process include: 
1. Choosing a topic: 
DCW will consume a considerable amount of your time, so identify a topic (a broad subject area) that 
sparks your interest, one that you are genuinely committed to exploring. This should be done in the 
semester prior to beginning DCW. 
 
2. Choosing a supervisor: 
Once you have picked a topic, you should select a supervisor based on broad research interests i.e., 
choose as a supervisor someone whose research interests align with your topic. This should also be 
done in the semester prior to beginning DCW. 
 
3. Registration: 
Once your supervisor has approved your SPROJ/Independent Study//DRP/SPROJ topic, you are 
required to complete the DCW registration form (available from the Programme Coordinator’s office 
as well as on the LUMS Portal), and submit it to the Programme Coordinator, who will forward it to the 
Office of the Registrar. The Office of the Registrar will not accept DCW forms directly from the students. 
 
4. Writing a research proposal: 
Submit an initial proposal to your supervisor explaining what you want to research, how you plan to 
research it, and when you will complete each task. The proposal should specify the following: 
(i) The research question: What is it that you really want to find out – what the specific problem is 
you want to address/specific question you want to answer 
(ii) A description of the data you will need and identification of the potential sources for obtaining it 
(e.g., primary and secondary sources). 
(iii) A description of the kinds of methods you intend to use to undertake your research. You may 
engage with theoretical or empirical research or both. For empirical research, you may employ 
qualitative or quantitative strategies, or use a mixed methods approach. What you choose will 
depend on your research question, your preferences, and your skills. 
(iv) Relevant courses and experiences that have prepared you to undertake the project. 
(v) The area of law that your proposal fits into e.g., Constitutional Law, Labor Law, Jurisprudence, 
Commercial Law, International Law, Islamic Law, Family Law. 
(vi) A timetable for the completion of the project. 
(vii) Division of labor if you are working as a group. 
 
5. Recommended timeline: 
You should aim to meet with your supervisor fortnightly. There should be a preliminary review halfway 
through your work. Below is a suggested timeline: 
(i) Submission of research proposal by the end of week 3. 
(ii) Submission of literature review/revised research questions by the end of week 6. 
(iii) Submission of first draft by the end of week 10. 
(iv) Submission of final draft by the end of week 13. 
(v) Oral defense by the end of week 14. 
 
The above timeline can be extended over a period of two semesters for an 8 credit hour SPROJ. Your 
supervisor may choose to assign separate grades for each stage with no less than 75% weightage assigned 
to the assessment of the final draft. 

203 
 
6. Grading: 
In general, all members in a group are awarded the same grade. However, at the discretion of the 
supervisor, different grades may be awarded to different group members based on objective evidence 
of differential performance. The supervisor may use presentations, oral defense or other such means 
in conjunction with the written report to assess performance. If the supervisor chooses to conduct an 
oral defense, this is done before members of the faculty. 
 
In the 5 years of your undergraduate BA-LL.B. (Honours) degree, advising (academic & non-academic) plays 
a vital role in shaping not just your academic career, but goes beyond those years into your professional 
lives as well. 
 
Academic Advising at SAHSOL 
 
The academic advising system at Shaikh Ahmad Hassan School of Law strives to ensure students have 
access to reliable information and diverse perspectives for making informed decisions about their 
academic, personal, and professional goals as they progress through each year of their law studies at LUMS. 
To this end, we offer a holistic network of advising support comprised of staff, faculty, peers, alumni, and 
other campus and community partners who work in synergy to meet varied and evolving student needs 
that may be academic or non-academic in nature.    
 
Students are encouraged to explore and utilize all advising resources and support available to them. 
Students may be asked to attend mandatory meetings with staff and/or faculty advisors for important 
discussions about their academic progress and plans. To facilitate more meaningful meetings with advisors, 
students may be required to complete a reflection form with specific topics that are appropriate for that 
time in their academic career and programme.    
  
A student’s thorough understanding of the BA-LLB degree plan and available advising resources is central 
to ensuring academic success. Students are responsible for:    
 
• 
Proactively seeking advice from relevant advisors   
• 
For understanding and meeting the requirements of the five-year BA-LLB programme.   
• 
For taking and completing courses in the proper sequence to ensure timely progress toward the 
degree    
   
Academic Advising for All Years:    
  
All students at SAHSOL have access to academic advising through the following channels:    
 
1. Academic Advising Staff: Provide individualized support to students in understanding and upholding 
university policies, procedures, and expectations. This includes but is not limited to understanding the 
requirements of the five-year law programme, navigating enrollment cycles, satisfying degree 
requirements, guidance on pursuing a minor, as well as assessing options to transfer across other 
degree programmes at LUMS. Advisors can also provide support to students with adjustment to 
university, personal growth, and career/professional development.    
 

204 
 
Advising staff also monitor students’ academic performance and offer one-on-one support and referral 
to other campus resources for overcoming any challenges or hardships that may impact students in 
achieving their academic goals.

4. Peer Ambassadors at LUMS for Social Support (Pod Pals): Facilitate academic information sharing, 
group social support, and coordination within and across batches. Each student is assigned to a Pod 
that consists of 12-15 students from different batches. Pods are led by a fourth- or fifth-year law 
student (PAL) who serves as a guide and mentor. Students may meet/communicate with their Pod 
PALS as a group or individually.  Topics of group discussion in a Pod may include understanding 
enrollment cycles, general study tips for law courses, adjusting to university life such as selecting and 
managing co-curriculars, and personal/professional interest exploration.    
 
  
To know more about the Pod PALs programme, email undergradadvising.sahsol@lums.edu.pk    
   
5. Specialized Workshops and Seminars: Organized for professional development and/or networking 
opportunities with alumni, legal scholars, practitioners, and other professionals to help students 
expand their interests and skillsets as well as to gain exposure to diverse career pathways within law.    
 
6. Online Resources: A range of resources are available at http://portal.lums.edu.pk/advising and 
https://sahsol.lums.edu.pk/ including handouts for major exploration, career planning, and 
information about support offered by other campus partners.   
   
Academic Advising for Specific Needs  
 
A. Additional support for At-Risk students in all years: Students on academic warning (with a CGPA 2.00 
– 2.50) and academic probation (with a CGPA below 2.00) are required to meet with academic advising 
staff at least twice a semester to discuss their challenges, progress, and any support they need to 
ensure they are improving their academic performance. They are also encouraged to meet with their 

205 
 
PALs and faculty advisor (if assigned one), instructors, and TAs to identify specific areas of 
improvement.   
 
B. First year and sophomores are expected to meet with Academic Advising staff at least once a semester 
to discuss their enrollment plans and progress on completion of pre-law requirements. They can also 
utilize PALS for individual and group support on social life adjustment, adapting to academic rigor and 
expectations as they transition into the BA phase, and how to chart their own unique path at 
LUMS. They are encouraged to meet with the Programme Coordinator to understand the requirements 
and expectations of the LLB curriculum.   
  
C. Junior year students can meet with the Programme Coordinator for understanding the requirements 
of law curriculum for the three years of the LLB phase, enrollment in law courses, Directed Research 
Project (DRP) applications, law elective course offerings, and for making alternate plans for degree

         SYED AHSAN ALI & SYED MARATIB ALI SCHOOL OF EDUCATION (SOE) 
 
SOE Undergraduate Academic Programmes 
 
Since its establishment in 2017, Syed Ahsan Ali & Syed Maratib Ali School of Education (SOE) has actively 
expanded its undergraduate repertories, leading to the introduction of two distinct undergraduate minor 
programmes: the Minor in Education with two separate streams and the Minor in Inclusive Education. 
These programs are designed to engage undergraduate students who are interested in diversifying their 
learning experiences and immersing themselves in education discourse. Students are provided 
opportunities to develop a comprehensive understanding of various education-related topics, like social 
justice in education, teaching and learning strategies, education policy and practice, educational 
technology, inclusive education, removing barriers to learning in the classroom and the role of education 
in conflict settings. Bridging together research, policy, and practice, the innovative curriculum of these 
programmes integrates academic knowledge with field-based learning and introduces students to the field 
of education. 
 
The course content is developed with the lens of an interdisciplinary perspective whereby it draws upon 
economic, political, social, cultural, and philosophical contexts to examine fundamental aspects of 
education, such as equity, reform, inclusivity, diversity, accountability, policy, and advocacy. As students 
explore these contexts, they gain insights into the core challenges faced by educators and policymakers in 
both national and international settings. Additionally, the minor streams encourage students to analyze 
current situations and propose solutions to the problems stemming from complex issues surrounding 
education policy and practice which connect with major areas of their study. 
 
Students have shown a significant interest in pursuing professional opportunities within the education 
sector, which has led SOE to establish partnerships with various organizations to facilitate real-time 
engagement with educational challenges. These provide opportunities to students to actively contribute 
to addressing and solving issues within the education ecosystem. 
 
The core requirements of the minor programs comprise courses on the philosophy of education, critical 
debates in education, inclusive education, understanding the diversity in disability, particularly those 
pertaining to access, inclusivity and equity in education. The courses aim to provide students with a solid 
foundation for understanding multifaceted dimensions in the education sector.  They are designed to equip 
undergraduates with the knowledge and skills necessary to analyze critically and propose solutions to the 
intricate challenges of education policy and practice. 
 
In Fall 2021, SOE introduced an undergraduate minor stream focusing on Education with an emphasis on 
Policy, Politics, and Governance. This stream aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding 
of education policy formulation, political processes, and power dynamics that influence policy outcomes. 
It also delves into the construction and role of governance structures in shaping policy implementation. 
In Fall 2022, SOE introduced another undergraduate minor stream focusing on Education with a 
specialization in Curriculum and Instruction. This stream requires students to engage with both theoretical 
and practical dimensions of curriculum development and instructional methods. Students gain valuable 
knowledge and skills related to course design, delivery, and pedagogy, which are essential for successful 
careers in education. 
 

208 
 
Due to begin in Fall 2023, SOE has introduced a stand-alone minor in Inclusive Education, which is based 
on providing students with a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical underpinnings and 
practical aspects of inclusive education. The program aims to equip students with the essential knowledge 
and skills needed to develop and implement inclusive curricula, pedagogical practices, and school cultures. 
 
Progressing ahead, SOE plans to introduce additional streams with different focus areas, including 
Educational Technology and Educational Entrepreneurship. These future streams aim to familiarize 
undergraduate students with essential education concepts which foster intellectual growth and personal 
development. 
Undergraduate Minor in Education

OFFICE OF FINANCIAL AID (OFA) 
 
Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has always striven to make quality education accessible 
to all students in Pakistan, including those from low and middle-income households. Since its inception till  
June 2023, LUMS has disbursed more than PKR 10.16 billion in financial assistance to its students. Currently, 
approximately 30% of the students at LUMS get some form of financial assistance based on their assessed 
financial needs. 
 
Admission to all programmes is purely on merit and independent of students’ ability to pay the related 
tuition fees. Once a student is admitted to a Programme, there are several mechanisms in place to provide 
financial support based on the student’s need and merit. All awards are reassessed each academic year. 
Funds are allocated based on performance, financial need, available resources, and the prevailing 
University policies. 
 
LUMS is committed to providing as much financial assistance as possible. Nevertheless, the University may 
not be able to meet all requests for financial assistance, and it is strongly recommended that applicants 
secure as much of their own funding as possible. 
 
Types of Awards 
Merit and Need-based scholarships available for students who meet specific criteria: 
1. Merit Scholarships 
2. Need-based Tuition-Fee Waivers and Interest-Free Loans 
3. National Outreach Programme (NOP) Fellowships

1. Merit Scholarship 
LUMS not only recognizes students' good academic performance but also distinguishes high achievers by 
providing them generous Merit scholarships. If you are a high achiever, LUMS wants you to accomplish 
everything you possibly can. Exemplary students are selected to receive LUMS Merit Scholarships on the 
basis of their outstanding academic performance. 
 
First Year 
100 scholarships are available to support the academic aspirations of the prospective top-ranked 
Undergraduate students based on the LUMS admission ranking. 
 
For the first year, Merit scholarship awards cover full and partial tuition fees and lab charges (where 
applicable) for One (1) year and are awarded to the top-ranked applicants shortlisted for admission to each 
school. There is no separate application for the merit scholarship. Applicants are automatically considered 
for the award if they qualify for the scholarship at the time of admission at LUMS. 
 
The break-up of 100 Merit scholarships for the first year is as follows: 
• 
30 scholarships for each batch of SDSB, MGSHSS and SBASSE 
• 
10 scholarships for the batch of SAHSOL 
 

216 
 
Subsequent Years 
Merit scholarship awards cover partial to full tuition fees and lab charges (where applicable) for one year 
only and are awarded to the top-ranked students from returning batches who are placed on Dean's Honour 
List based on their academic performance. The number of scholarships may vary each year. 
 
The break-up of merit scholarships for subsequent years is as follows: 
• 
15 scholarships for each batch of SDSB, MGSHSS and SBASSE 
• 
5 scholarships for the batch of SAHSOL 
 
Note:  
1. In case a student qualifies for both financial aid and merit scholarship, their merit award will be 
adjusted accordingly. 
2. All these awards are for One (1) year only and cannot be carried forward to subsequent years.  
3. The scholarship will cover 40 credit hours for an academic year. 
 
2. Need-based Tuition Fee Waivers and Loan 
These awards are available in the form of Tuition fee waivers and Interest-free loans. A Financial Aid fee 
waiver is not required to be repaid whilst LUMS Interest-Free Loan will have to be paid back after six (6) 
months of graduation within a period of three (3) to five (5) years  
 
 Financial aid covers partial to a full tuition fee of the Programme. For the Undergraduate SBASSE students, 
it also includes the cost of Lab charges. These awards are revaluated in each academic year based upon 
performance and financial need assessed via the information in the financial aid application and the 
required supporting documents. 
 
3. National Outreach Programme (NOP) Scholarship  
LUMS launched its National Outreach Programme (NOP) in 2001 to extend the benefits of world-class 
education to talented students all over Pakistan. This prestigious scholarship programme focuses on 
identifying bright students with exceptional academic record and from highly underprivileged backgrounds 
where families cannot afford to support their children’s university education. The scholars that qualify are 
provided full funding that includes total tuition fee waiver and a stipend to meet all other expenses. For

Fellowships are named after distinguished academics, teachers, practitioners, and scientists who have 
made distinct contributions to the learning of science and maths, or who have made revolutionary 
discoveries describing our universe.  
 
These Fellowships are created from a generous donation received from Packages Limited honouring the 
90th birthday of the Founder of the School, Syed Babar Ali. The Fellowships are aimed to bolster interest 
in fundamental science and to incentivize students to major in basic sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology 
and Mathematics). The creation of these Fellowships will draw more students towards their genuine 
passion. 
Some further rules of the proposed Fellowship are given below: 
• 
The eligible students must have completed a minimum of 30 Credits Hours in a Year (Fall 

217 
 
and Spring). 
• 
The eligibility criterion is a CGPA of 3.5 or above. 
Only those candidates are eligible who have not received a 50% or higher scholarship through other 
financial support like merit and LUMS financial aid. 
If any candidate in a batch does not meet the minimum eligibility criterion (i.e., CGPA of 3.5), the award 
will be transferred to the next eligible and highest CGPA candidate in the other batches. 
• 
Also note that CGPAs obtained by factoring in Pass grades obtained by converting letter grades under 
the Pass/No Credit or Pass/Fail policies will be excluded from the eligibility for this fellowship. 
• 
Students enrolled in the Economics-Maths programme will not be eligible. 
• 
Recipients of the Fellowship will not be allowed to change majors out of the four specified subjects at 
any time in their undergraduate studies. 
 
5. External Scholarships 
External Funding is available in the form of full as well as partial scholarships for deserving students based 
on need and merit. Students are shortlisted for external scholarships based upon eligibility criteria specified 
by the donors. Each Scholarship has its specifications and preferences.

Loan Recovery Section   
LUMS offers a substantial amount of financial aid and scholarships, and although scholarships and financial 
aids in the form of grant are always preferred as they do not require repayment, but even after awarding 
scholarships and financial aid offered as grant, many students still face a gap in paying their university dues 
which may require a student loan.  Students at LUMS receive loans on special terms and provisions with 
zero interest, that makes it more affordable and manageable for young university -bound students.  
The Loan Recovery section facilitates repayment of these loans from students once they become due.  The 
section may assess any deferred payment or repayment grace period options following graduation in order 

223 
 
to relieve any evident financial pressure on these students. All such cases are assessed, verified and 
processed through Loan Recovery section.

OFFICE OF ACADEMIC ADVISING AND STUDENT SUCCESS 
 
Goal of Advising At LUMS 
Students at LUMS have a range of options and opportunities available to them, as detailed in this 
Handbook. The goal of advising is to ensure that all students have access to appropriate support and 
information needed to facilitate informed decision-making. It is then up to the student to make the most 
out of these resources and support to optimize their undergraduate experience.  
 
Mechanisms of Advising 
Each school at LUMS has designed an advising system that seeks to provide students with the appropriate 
information and support. Depending on the school, this advising system may involve faculty advisers, staff 
advisers, Peer ambassadors, group sessions/workshops and online resources. Further, most schools have 
different advising-expectations and advising-supports depending on the class year (first-year, sophomore, 
juniors, senior, super-seniors). 
 
The Role of the Office of Academic Advising and Student Success:  
The Office of Academic Advising and Student Success (OAASS) is a central university office that works 
closely with schools as a thought-partner as well as a standard-setting and capacity-building partner. More 
specifically, the Office works as a thought-partner with each school’s Dean and Advising Unit staff to: i) get 
input from stakeholders (students, faculty, staff and alumni); ii) identify university-wide standards and 
goals for advising at LUMS; iii) build capacity within each school’s advising system to meet these standards 
and goals and iv) monitor advising at LUMS to ensure these standards/goals are consistently met.  
 
 

227 
 
The Advising Website:  
The office has collaborated with Career Services Office and Advancement/Alumni Relations to create 
various digital resources on exploring majors, careers, and graduate studies, among other topics. These 
resources are available at: https://advising.lums.edu.pk/ 
 
Contacting the Office of Academic Advising: 
The first point of contact for advising issues should be school advising staff. The details of each school’s 
undergraduate advisement structure are given within the sections for each school within the Handbook. 
For any issues in connecting with school advisers, or for suggestions for the advising system at LUMS, 
students, faculty, and staff can email the Office of Academic Advising and Student Success at 
advising@lums.edu.pk.  
 
Student Success: 
The goal of Student Success is to enhance programming and support at LUMS, to improve student 
experience on campus and beyond. The Student Success team works towards this goal by identifying unmet 
student needs and addresses them by collaborating with campus-partners on new initiatives. For example, 
in 2020, the Office of Academic Advising and Student Success partnered with the NOP Centre to create the 
NOP Student Success Initiative. This joint initiative collaboratively develops and implements a range of 
programmes for the benefit of the NOP community and other student populations. Details about this 
Initiative can be found under the NOP section. Other examples of Student Success contributions to the 
campus include the OSA Campus Case Manager (who provides pastoral care to students struggling with 
severe academic or wellbeing concerns), support for greater peer tutoring and mentoring across campus, 
various skill-building programs and events, etc. If you have ideas for improved student support on campus,

addition within allocated resources.

4. The Counselling and Psychological Service (CAPS) 
The Counselling and Psychological Service (CAPS) was founded on the principles which include: “to heal, to 
care and to educate” the student community at LUMS.  
 
The CAPS team includes a dedicated group of professionals who have chosen to work in a university mental 
health setting because they know how important it is to support student emotional health and well-being.  
 
The CAPS center provides free and confidential counselling to all students enrolled in LUMS and strives to 
“help students help themselves”. The CAPS therapists listen to students in a non-judgmental manner and 
are committed to helping them explore areas of concern and working on strategies which can assist them.  
 
The therapists at CAPS are aware that taking care of student mental health is a critical skill that will help 
students navigate their way through life – both as a student and beyond.  
 
At CAPS attending counselling does not mean there is anything wrong with the student; it simply provides 
a confidential and neutral place for students to freely express their needs and concerns.  
 
Counselling sessions are not registered on the student’s academic record. Counselling is simply a place to 
get some support and assistance that will help the student get through their studies.

OFFICE OF PROGRAMME ENHANCEMENT (OPE) 
The Office of Programme Enhancement (OPE) works to leverage data to support the strategic 
decision-making processes of the university's senior administration. OPE’s core activities revolve 
around two primary functional areas: Institutional Research, where institution-wide data is used to 
gauge how well LUMS is fulfilling its mission; and Quality Assurance, through which OPE ensures 
regulatory compliance and conducts internal quality assessments.  
Through institutional research and quality assurance, OPE serves as a vital resource to various 
stakeholders within and outside the university community. The office acts as the primary interface 
with the Higher Education Commission on matters related to quality assurance. Furthermore, it is 
responsible for coordinating efforts for LUMS’ placement in world university rankings, for example 
the Times Higher Education Rankings and the QS Rankings. In essence, through rigorous analysis and 
by upholding strict standards, OPE identifies areas for improvement and guarantees that LUMS 
maintains its commitment to excellence in all facets of its operations. 
OPE can be reached at ope@lums.edu.pk. Additionally, the following extension numbers can be 
used: 2269, 2289, 2248, and 2236. 
 
OFFICE OF ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION (OAI) 
 
LUMS takes pride in the diversity of its community. With students, staff and faculty coming from all corners 
of the country and beyond, the University is an intellectual and cultural hub rich with varying perspectives 
and transformative ideas. The LUMS community welcomes members of different ethnic and religious 
minorities, the transgender community, those who struggle with physical, cognitive and learning 
disabilities and aims to make the learning environment not only safe but inclusive and accessible for all.  
 
The Office of Accessibility and Inclusion (OAI) has been set up as a means to fulfil this commitment and is 
dedicated to the inclusion of all members of the community thereby upholding the core values of LUMS 
which include merit, academic freedom, integrity, diversity, tolerance and excellence. It aims to provide 
every member of the LUMS community an equal opportunity to participate in the University's programmes, 
and benefit from all the available services, just like their peers and empathetically addresses any issues 
that might be causing a hinderance in their learning journey here.  
 
Work at the Office is informed by conversations, input and perspectives from students, staff and faculty 
throughout the University resulting in initiatives that are impactful and bring members of the community 
closer together.  
 
The University recognizes that each individual is unique with a specific set of challenges and continues to 
evolve into a campus that is accessible and accommodating for everyone. From scholarships for women to 

253 
 
accessible restrooms, academic accommodation, and assistive technologies, LUMS aspires towards a No-
Borders agenda; a commitment that no obstacle should come in the way of any individual, from fully 
experiencing LUMS and the opportunities it has to offer.  
 
Focus Areas 
Gender Sensitization  
Women, men and members of the transgender community, all experience the campus differently. A female 
student, a male member of the faculty or a transgender staff member might all move through the campus 
with completely different vantage points. In order to create understanding and empathy for each other’s 
experience and the challenges it entails, the Office of Accessibility and Inclusion plans to expand on existing 
gender sensitization trainings on campus and organize relevant seminars and workshops for everyone on 
campus.  
 
Accessibility 
The Office is determined to make all spaces on campus accessible to people with disabilities. Each disability 
has its own unique challenges which is why the work being done in this regard is two-fold. OAI is working 
on making the campus more accessible to people with physical disabilities; we are also looking into assistive 
technology to help students with learning disabilities excel in their classes and facilitators for students with 
visual or hearing impairments. Currently, OAI has provision for facilitators to help any student who may 
require help in moving across campus, taking notes in class, or other hurdles that may become easier with 
the help of a friend. Please email us at aaa@lums.edu.pk for more information on how to arrange a 
facilitator.  
 
 
Academic Accommodations 
The Academic Accommodation & Accessibility (AAA) wing at the Office of Accessibility & Inclusion (OAI) 
aims at providing the LUMS community a non-discriminatory environment for their academic journey. In 
accordance with the HEC Disability Policy 2021, our office facilitates an equitable and inclusive environment 
where students are supported in their academic activities. AAA provides support to students with long-
standing disabilities which can be visible or invisible in nature through reasonable academic 
accommodations and/or accessibility facilitation. The process for accommodations can be initiated in the 
following ways:   
 
1. At the time of admission, and recalibrated throughout the completion of the degree program.   
2. Before the beginning of each semester to be applicable in that semester  
3. During the degree program, if a student has met with a physical, medical, or mental health 
condition that hinders their regular ability to function, they may also reach out to apply for 
academic accommodations.   
4. If a student applies for accommodations after the midterms, the case will be managed after 
consultation with all relevant stakeholders, keeping in mind the timelines required for 
documentation and diagnosis.   
  
Students must submit their complete physical and/or mental health documentation when requesting 
academic accommodations. AAA will provide a guideline document delineating the office's requirements 
from the treating medical or mental health professionals for assessment and granting accommodations. 
For mental health, students may also obtain their assessment through CAPS. After reviewing and verifying 

254 
 
all documentation and conducting a meeting with the student, AAA will propose a plan for each student 
that addresses their accommodations concerns.   
 
Confidentiality is a fundamental value at OAI, so when accommodation plans are shared with concerned 
instructors and/or relevant departments/schools, the student's disability is not disclosed. For academic 
accommodations requests and/or queries, students can email us at aaa@lums.edu.pk   
 
Application Process  
 
1. All applicants must fill out the official accommodation request form. QR code for a google form is 
available outside our office, on key campus boards, and on official websites for easy access. These 
forms can also be obtained via email.    
2. Book a meeting with the Accessibility Coordinators. The form also directs applicants to a bookings 
calendar to set up a meeting with one of the Accessibility Coordinators. This meeting is a 
mandatory step towards beginning the processing of the application.   
3. Depending on the student’s eligibility as per the AAA policy, their proposed academic 
accommodations plan, comprising of the instruments they require facilitation with, is then shared 
with the relevant faculty and/or department for implementation. Certain cases may be forwarded 
to the Accessibility Committee for further evaluation.   
  
Accessibility Committee (AC)  
The members of the LUMS community are governed by the Higher Education Commission Policy for 
Students with Disabilities at Higher Educational Institutions in Pakistan 2021, while the LUMS’ Accessibility 
Policy is undergoing approval. The Accessibility Committee follows the rules and guidelines outlined by the 
former.   
Any plans that may not reach their implementation during the informal process may be routed to the 
Accessibility Committee. As per the decision of the Accessibility Committee, the agreed upon 
accommodations 
and/or 
accessibility 
needs 
shall 
be 
communicated 
to 
the 
relevant 
faculty/authority/department by the AAA office. The AAA office shall facilitate the implementation of the 
agreed upon accommodations and/or accessibility needs.   
 
Academic Accommodation: Things to Know  
 
• 
Academic accommodations are only applicable from the date they are shared with instructors, and 
they do not apply retrospectively.  
• 
For all missed components, even for students who are on academic accommodations, only a 
petition can be filed by contacting Student Support Services at OSA and approval of petition will 
be as per OSA policies. AAA does not accommodate missed components under any circumstances.  
• 
Course material and examination formats cannot be modified; only alternative assessment 
modalities and certain flexibilities can be offered for graded components under academic 
accommodations.   
• 
Application process for academic accommodations officially begins with the start of the semester 
and application forms need to be submitted by the students by the end of add/drop week. Timely 
submission of the application form, documents and booking of meetings or follow-ups will be the 
students’ responsibility, and all steps must be completed within the timelines given by the office 
at the start of each semester.   

255 
 
• 
Once the proposed academic accommodation plans are sent out, the student is required to discuss 
their plans with their respective instructors for its implementation. Under no circumstances can 
components be added or removed by either party.  
• 
Students and instructors can both file a grievance with our office if they face any difficulty with the 
implementation or are unsatisfied with the adequacy of the accommodations plan. The grievance 
form will be made available via email.   
• 
If a student's condition changes in any way or, for any reason, a student feels the need to request 
for additional accommodations, they can get in touch with our office and discuss this with the 
Accessibility Coordinators. However, grant of additional accommodations may require additional 
documentation and depends upon student’s eligibility.

Awareness and Dialogue 
A free exchange of ideas is at the heart of the educational experience at LUMS and results in life-changing 
collaborations, ground-breaking research and transformative initiatives. Building on the University’s 
culture of genuine conversations and dialogue, the OAI plans to have students, staff and faculty interact 
and engage with each other in a safe and supportive environment. The aim of these initiatives is to provide 
the LUMS community with the space to share their experience, challenges and concerns as they navigate 
their life at the University. The hope is that these conversations will further foster awareness and empathy 
within the community members for each other’s varying experiences and individual struggles. One such 
effort includes conducting university wide Sexual Harassment Awareness Trainings. The purpose of these 
trainings is to encourage conversation on important matters like sexual harassment, gender, consent, 
bystander intervention and role of a first responder to create a more informed, respectful, aware, and 
responsible culture on campus.  
 
Sexual Harassment Inquiry Committee (SHIC) 
The members of the LUMS community are governed both by LUMS’ own harassment policy as well as the 
Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2010. The Sexual Harassment Inquiry 
Committee (SHIC), which is housed in the Office of Accessibility and Inclusion, follows the rules and 
guidelines outlined by these two. 
 
A victim of sexual harassment has the right to bring either an informal or a formal complaint to the 
committee. Informal complaints are usually resolved through mediation, while formal complaints can 
include penalties from community service and mandatory counseling to expulsion or ban from campus, 
depending on the circumstances of any given case.  
 

257 
 
The SHIC works to resolve cases as quickly as possible, and ideally (assuming full cooperation of all parties) 
within 30 days. The procedure for a formal complaint looks something like this: 
 
The complainant first fills out the official sexual harassment complaint form and questionnaire and submit 
it to harassment@lums.edu.pk. Along with the form, they should provide as much relevant evidence as 
possible, such as text communication, photos, or videos, that document the harassment or its impact, as 
well as a list of potential witnesses to any harassment. 
 
The SHIC will contact the accused and inform them of the complaint, and request they respond to the 
charges. The accused can provide their own evidence or witnesses and a written statement addressing the 
charges. They may choose to send cross-examination questions for the complainant and the complainant’s 
witnesses, which will be conveyed by the committee. The SHIS will gather as much evidence and witness 
testimony as possible. Both the complainant and accused will be given a chance to respond to the evidence 
and testimony presented by the other side.  
 
After reviewing all the evidence and testimony and consulting among themselves, the committee provides 
their decision in the form of a report, that is sent to the Competent Authority (the Vice Chancellor) for 
implementation.  The report is sent to the relevant parties and penalties are carried out through either the 
OSA or the HR after the VC’s approval.  
 
Filing a Complaint: Things to Know 
• 
An informal complaint can be turned into a formal complaint at any time.  
• 
It is paramount that you provide as much and as complete evidence as possible regarding your case. 
This may include digital communication (not just with the accused, but with others you may have 
discussed the case with), photographs, videos, audio files, notes from healthcare providers and 
counsellors, or any other thing you can think of that is relevant. 
• 
Both the complainant and accused can appoint a representative to support them throughout the 
proceedings. This person need not be a lawyer, they can be a family member or close friend. 
• 
A case cannot be filed on someone else’s behalf, nor should any person be pressured into filing a case. 
• 
During an inquiry, involved parties are under a no contact order and must not communicate with each

The Communications department is committed to sharing the LUMS story in a manner that informs, 
inspires, and engages audiences. As a strategic partner to the University, the team works collaboratively 
with multiple collaborators, to curate and shape messages into stories and experiences that elevate the

Alumni Relations 
The mission of Alumni Relations is to ensure sustainable and meaningful engagement with the alumni body. 
It aims to continuously establish new ways of connecting, which will better meet the needs of alumni, 
students, and the University. Engaging the alumni involves fostering a relationship with this ever-growing 
community, strengthening their connection with their alma mater, including them in the University’s 
countless initiatives, and providing them with opportunities that help enhance their professional and 
personal lives. 
 
To facilitate networking, Alumni Relations has formed alumni chapters in various cities and countries all 
over the world. In addition to providing a forum for socialising, these chapters are a source of great support 
for newcomers to the area. They also help the University with its marketing, placement, and fundraising 
efforts. To facilitate even closer networks amongst the alumni, Alumni Relations has also formed affinity-

263

Alumni Association and aims to create more in the future. 
 
Alumni Relations communicates with the alumni community through the alumni website, the Connect

Through these channels, alumni can get the latest information on LUMS, job openings, alumni benefits, 
corporate discounts, faculty research, alumni success stories, activities of LUMS alumni chapters, and 
general news and announcements. A major part of the engagement with alumni focuses on reunions and 
events. Batches and chapters get together for different kinds of reunions throughout the year from batch 
teas and mentorship workshops, to guest speaker sessions and class reunions. In addition, the flagship 
event of the year for the alumni community is Homecoming where alumni are welcomed back to campus 
for all kinds of knowledge sharing and entertainment.

LUMS LEARNING INSTITUTE (LLI) 
LLI is a development center at LUMS, dedicated to enhancing teaching, learning, and career progression 
within the higher education sector – faculty, staff & students alike. Over the last four years, we have 

264 
 
distinguished ourselves by offering a wide range of developmental programs that have significantly 
impacted learning and development – both within and outside of LUMS. 
 
Core Programmes  
At our core, we empower faculty with cutting-edge pedagogical strategies, offering workshops on 
instructional skills, course design, and peer feedback integration. We have also created discipline-specific 
learning experiences in Economics, Law, Business, Languages, and Data Science, as well as supported 
faculty in incorporating advanced, technology-led pedagogical solutions, which has considerably enriched 
the academic environment at LUMS. Our focus areas are: 
 
1. Faculty Support 
➢ Faculty Certificate in Teaching and Learning 
LLI launched the Faculty Certificate in Teaching and Learning FCTL for the faculty at LUMS to support and 
empower them in their on-going growth to become world-acclaimed higher-ed faculty. FCTL caters to 
different faculty needs and interests through customized school-specific interventions and offers 
differentiated routes to completion for faculty at different points in their career. The modules of the 
certificate enable participants to hone their instructional skills, offer useful insights about course de 
ign, cultivate observation as well as feedback for professional growth, and develop learning communities. 
An advanced level of the certificate offers support to the faculty in developing a teaching dossier, which 
involves designing and assembling evidence to support their teaching excellence. Some of our offerings 
included in the certificate are as follows: 
➢ Faculty Consultation 
We at LLI offer personalized pedagogical consultations to faculty, focusing on enhancing teaching 
effectiveness and student engagement. Our expert consultants provide tailored advice on curriculum 
design, innovative teaching strategies, and the integration of technology in the classroom. These 
consultations help faculty refine their instructional methods, fostering a more dynamic and effective 
learning environment for students. 
➢ Scholarship of Teaching and Learning 
LLI leads and collaborates on research that informs their work in supporting evidence-based pedagogy, 
contributes to institutional teaching and learning priorities, and develops new knowledge about teaching 
and learning. We aim to support and recognize teaching and learning research through future 
programming and by creating opportunities for scholarly discussion, dissemination, and recognition. 
 
➢ Vice Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Teaching and Learning 
The Vice Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Teaching demonstrates the value LUMS attributes to the core 
function of teaching and learning. Each Award recognizes the contributions of individuals who, through 
innovation, commitment, and continued excellence in teaching have significantly enhanced the quality of 
their students’ learning experiences. The Award recognizes sustained achievement with weight given to 
evidence of continuing effort and outstanding contributions in teaching and learning over several years. 
Outstanding contributions capture the intellectual growth of students and enhanced student learning that 
results from innovative teaching in the classroom, the mentorship of students through involvement in 
research or practical experience, the development of novel and effective educational materials, and 
leadership that promotes teaching and learning at LUMS. 5 Awards have been awarded this year to faculty 
members across schools. 
 

265 
 
 
2. Student Support 
➢ Pedagogical Partnership Programme 
Students are another key stakeholder in our development initiatives. LLI empowers students with lifelong 
skills, involving them in pedagogical partnerships to contribute to course content, delivery, and assessment 
tool development. Being in a pedagogical partnership provides compensation for students to work as full 
members of project teams with faculty and/or staff. The visioning work for the programme began in Fall 
2019 with a core group of faculty staff and student advisors from across LUMS. It was insp 
red by similar partnership programmes from institutions worldwide who have shared widespread benefits 
of involving students as partners in diverse educational projects.  
 
The Pedagogical Partnership Programme has successfully completed four academic years at LUMs. The 
programme was piloted over the summer and fall of 2020 and has supported pedagogical partnerships 
with more than 60+ student partners and 50 faculty/staff partners to date. 
 
➢ TA Development Programme 
TA Development is one of LLI’s successfully running initiatives that caters to the needs of LUMS TAs. 
Initially, the program was offered as a series of three webinars (on Effective Communication, Feedback and 
Course Management) and an in-person Panel Discussion. However, in collaboration with LUMSx, it has now 
transitioned into a full-fledged course titled as Teaching Assistants Professional Development Course 
(TAPDC), an online asynchronous offering designed to prepare and enhance students' skills as Teaching 
Assistants at LUMS. A Guidebook for TAs was also launched this year to provide TAs with tools and support 
to help them maximize their experience as a TA at LUMS. The guidebook is currently under revision and an 
updated version will be shared with the LUMS Community by Fall 2023 
 
3. Technology-enhanced Learning 
In this technology and AI-driven age of learning, LLI offers support to the faculty and students to build and 
sustain engaging and technologically advanced learning experiences. By identifying gaps in the classroom 
experience of teachers as well as students, , we have developed specialized training programs in various 
generative AI tools for a diverse audience of faculty, staff, and students. These training courses are 
designed to meet specific needs, such as course and assessment design for faculty, and productivity 
enhancement for professionals, as well as AI interventions tailored for developers and data scientists at 
LUMS.  
 
Additionally, LLI is dedicated to empowering educators through tech-enhanced interactive workshops that 
explore innovative teaching methods and technologies. Our sessions, led by expert facilitators, focus on 
practical strategies for large classrooms, flipped classrooms, and design thinking for both online and offline 
learning. We provide hands-on activities, mini-lectures, and group discussions to enhance teaching 
effectiveness and create dynamic, student-centered learning environments. These workshops have a 
profound impact, equipping educators with the tools and confidence to transform their teaching practices 
 
and significantly improve student engagement and outcomes.
 
4. Strategic Initiatives 
The quality and impact of our offerings have allowed us recognition not just in LUMS but also for our 
audiences beyond our borders. With the close support of the Center of Continuing Education Studies (CES), 
we have managed to further our impact through several programmes. Under the Signature Pedagogy 
series, we have collectively trained a 100+ higher-education faculty members from across Pakistan to 

266 
 
design and deliver data science courses and inculcate machine learning in their pedagogy. Over 300 
professionals from various fields, including academic advising, marketing, web development, and data 
analysis, have enhanced their productivity through our AI tool workshops. Additionally, more than 70 
educators and trainers have refined their teaching and training methods through Mastering the Art of 
Teaching & Training, all possible through our meaningful collaborations. 
We are also currently running the Certificate of Health Professions Education (CHPE) and the Diploma of 
Healthcare Ethics & Professionalism (DHEP), two hybrid programs in collaboration with HSA, Islamabad, 
and Shalamar Medical & Dental College, Lahore, respectively, which exemplifies our expansion into 
healthcare education. This initiative trains over a 100 doctors and health professionals in instructional skills, 
AI, Data Science, Ethics, Leadership, Bioethics and Clinical Research, further showcasing our commitment 
to interdisciplinary learning and development.

Information Security 
(InfoSec@lums.edu.pk) 
Information Security team at LUMS is responsible for incidents such as password theft, compliance against

minimize vulnerabilities, this team facilitates behavioral change and develops a culture of continuous 
learning and security awareness. 
 
Queries/concerns about Information Security Policies are also managed by this team. 
 
Sometimes users received phishing and fraudulent emails impersonating higher management or faculty, 
requesting urgent assistance with a funds transfer or asking for personal information, including 
passwords. 
We urge you to remain vigilant and take the following precautions: 
- 
Verify the Email Address: Always check if the email address is official. Official university emails 
will not come from personal addresses like Gmail, Yahoo, etc. If the email address is not official, 
ignore the email. 
- 
Evaluate the Content: Phishing emails often contain generic and ambiguous language. If the 
message seems suspicious or unusual, do not respond or click on any link asking for the personal 
information or passwords. 
- 
Contact the Sender Directly: If you are unsure about the legitimacy of an email, contact the 
sender through an alternative communication method such as phone or WhatsApp. Do not use 
the contact information provided in the suspicious email. 
 
If you have any doubts or receive any suspicious emails, please report them to the IST department 
immediately at infosec@lums.edu.pk

to suggest other avenues of support. The helpdesk mission is to ensure a positive experience and a speedy 
resolution resulting in the efficient use of technology tools for our academic setting.

access to key University facilities including office blocks, student hostels, library, computing labs, sports 
complex and the aquatic center.   
 
The policy is applicable to: 
• 
All LUMS Community. 
• 
Alumni. 
 
The LUMS smart card will only grant access during the hours of operations of the different facilities on 
campus.  
  
Applicable Policies 
• 
It is mandatory that each student and alumnus obtain their LUMS smart card from the main security 
office of the University. 
• 
It is mandatory to carry your smart card all the time when on campus. A University security 
representative can ask you for identification, and without the card you will not be able to access various 
locations on campus. 
• 
The issued smart card will be valid for the entire duration of user’s degree period. 
• 
Cards are not transferable from one person to another. Only the person pictured on the card is 
authorized to use the card.  

280 
 
• 
For graduating classes, student’s smart card would be returned to security office for issuance of Alumni 
card. Returned smart card will be de-activated right after the issuance of Alumni card on their 
graduation ceremony.  
• 
In case card is lost or stolen, the card owner must inform Security office immediately through an email 
at campus.security@lums.edu.pk so that access privileges can be timely revoked to prevent any 
untoward security incident.  
• 
Once issued in a working condition, the protection of the smart card is a sole responsibility of the user. 
In case of non-functional or worn-out card, the decision of the issuing authority will be considered as 
final. The cardholder will be charged a card replacement fee. 
• 
Student user profiles are retained by LUMS for a period of three months after graduation. 
 
Note: Students on financial aid can file their appeal for smart card fee reduction through Financial Aid Office. 
LUMS reserves the right to withdraw the card at any time. 
 
 
 
Policy Violations

access to facilities (tail gating). 
 
Tampering with access control hardware and surveillance devices, theft and damage to University property 
e.g. door, glass, access control hardware, surveillance cameras etc. 
 
User Forgets to Bring Card 
In case a user forgets to bring his/her card at work, he/she should visit LUMS security office adjunct main 
IN Gate. However, there would be a usage limitation applicable in order to discourage people from making 
this a habit. 
 
Penalties and Fines 
If violations are proved against a person, his/her Smartcard would be immediately deactivated, and fines 
up to 20,000 PKR (Twenty Thousand Pakistan Rupees) could be imposed. In case of theft and damage to 
University property additional fines may be imposed. 
 
Serious violations of the policy will be referred directly to the appropriate Disciplinary Committee, and 
could result in severance from degree programme. 
 
Lost or stolen card 
The loss or theft of a smart card must be notified to the LUMS security office immediately in person. The 
cardholder credentials can also be verified from the LUMS active directory through his campus ID. 
 
In case the cardholder is not able to visit the said office, he must inform security by sending an email from 
LUMS account on campus.security@lums.edu.pk and reconfirming status via telephone within next twelve 
hours (Ext : 2560).
